<p>&ldquo;Of all the paper I have blotted, I have written nothing without
the intention of some good. Whether I have succeeded or not, is for
others to judge.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="rt sc">Sir William Temple.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> minds of young people are now manufactured
like webs of linen, all alike, and nothing left to
nature. From the hour when children can speak, till
they come to years of discretion or of indiscretion,
they are carefully prompted what to say, and what to
think, and what to look, and how to feel; while in
most school-rooms nature has been turned out of doors
with obloquy, and art has entirely supplanted her.</p>

<p>When a quarrel takes place, both parties are generally
in some degree to blame; therefore if Art and
Nature could yet be made to go hand in hand towards
the formation of character and principles, a graceful
and beautiful superstructure might be reared, on the
solid foundation of Christian faith and sound morality;
so that while many natural weeds and wild flowers
would be pruned and carefully trained, some lovely
blossoms that spring spontaneously in the uncultivated
soil, might still be cherished into strength and beauty,
far excelling what can be planted or reared by art.</p>

<p><a name="f0004.png" id="f0004.png" href="#f0004.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">iv</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>Every infant is probably born with a character as
peculiar to himself as the features in his countenance,
if his faults and good qualities were permitted to expand
according to their original tendency; but education,
which formerly did too little in teaching &ldquo;the
young idea how to shoot,&rdquo; seems now in danger of
over-shooting the mark altogether, by not allowing the
young ideas to exist at all. In this age of wonderful
mechanical inventions, the very mind of youth seems
in danger of becoming a machine; and while every
effort is used to stuff the memory, like a cricket-ball,
with well-known facts and ready-made opinions, no
room is left for the vigour of natural feeling, the glow of
natural genius, and the ardour of natural enthusiasm.
It was a remark of Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s many years ago,
to the author herself, that in the rising generation there
would be no poets, wits, or orators, because all play of
imagination is now carefully discouraged, and books
written for young persons are generally a mere dry
record of facts, unenlivened by any appeal to the heart,
or any excitement to the fancy. The catalogue of a
child&#8217;s library would contain Conversations on Natural
Philosophy,&mdash;on Chemistry,&mdash;on Botany,&mdash;on Arts
and Sciences,&mdash;Chronological Records of History,&mdash;and
travels as dry as a road-book; but nothing on the
habits or ways of thinking, natural and suitable to the
taste of children; therefore, while such works are delightful
to the parents and teachers who select them,
the younger community are fed with strong meat instead
of milk, and the reading which might be a relaxation
from study, becomes a study in itself.</p>

<p>In these pages the author has endeavoured to paint
that species of noisy, frolicsome, mischievous children
<a name="f0005.png" id="f0005.png" href="#f0005.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">v</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>which is now almost extinct, wishing to preserve a sort
of fabulous remembrance of days long past, when
young people were like wild horses on the prairies, rather
than like well-broken hacks on the road; and when,
amidst many faults and many eccentricities, there was
still some individuality of character and feeling allowed
to remain. In short, as Lord Byron described &ldquo;the
last man,&rdquo; the object of this volume is, to describe &ldquo;the
last boy.&rdquo; It may be useful, she thinks, to show, that
amidst much requiring to be judiciously curbed and
corrected, there may be the germs of high and generous
feeling, and of steady, right principle, which should be
the chief objects of culture and encouragement. Plodding
industry is in the present day at a very high premium
in education; but it requires the leaven of mental
energy and genius to make it work well, while it
has been remarked by one whose experience in education
is deep and practical, that &ldquo;those boys whose
names appear most frequently in the black book of
transgression, would sometimes deserve to be also most
commonly recorded, if a book were kept for warm affections
and generous actions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most formidable person to meet in society at
present, is the mother of a promising boy, about nine or
ten years old; because there is no possible escape from
a volume of anecdotes, and a complete system of education
on the newest principles. The young gentleman
has probably asked leave to bring his books to the
breakfast-room,&mdash;can scarcely be torn away from his
studies at the dinner-hour,&mdash;discards all toys,&mdash;abhors
a holiday,&mdash;propounds questions of marvellous depth
in politics or mineralogy,&mdash;and seems, in short, more
fitted to enjoy the learned meeting at Newcastle, than the
<a name="f0006.png" id="f0006.png" href="#f0006.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">vi</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>exhilarating exercises of the cricket-ground; but, if
the axiom be true, that &ldquo;a little learning is a dangerous
thing,&rdquo; it has also been proved by frequent, and
sometimes by very melancholy experience, that, for
minds not yet expanded to maturity, a great deal of
learning is more dangerous still, and that in those
school-rooms where there has been a society for the
suppression of amusement, the mental energies have
suffered, as well as the health.</p>

<p>A prejudice has naturally arisen against giving works
of fiction to children, because their chief interest too
often rests on the detection and punishment of such
mean vices as lying and stealing, which are so frequently
and elaborately described, that the way to commit
those crimes is made obvious, while a clever boy
thinks he could easily avoid the oversights by which
another has been discovered, and that if he does not
yield to similar temptations, he is a model of virtue and
good-conduct.</p>

<p>In writing for any class of readers, and especially in
occupying the leisure moments of such peculiarly fortunate
young persons as have leisure moments at all,
the author feels conscious of a deep responsibility, for
it is at their early age that the seed can best be sown
which shall bear fruit unto eternal life, therefore it is
hoped this volume may be found to inculcate a pleasing
and permanent consciousness, that religion is the best
resource in happier hours, and the only refuge in hours
of affliction.</p>

<p>Those who wish to be remembered for ever in the
world,&mdash;and it is a very common object of ambition,&mdash;will
find no monument more permanent, than the affectionate
remembrance of any children they have
<a name="f0007.png" id="f0007.png" href="#f0007.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">vii</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>treated with kindness; for we may often observe, in
the reminiscences of old age, a tender recollection surviving
all others, of friends in early days who enlivened
the hours of childhood by presents of playthings
and comfits. But above all, we never forget those who
good-humouredly complied with the constantly recurring
petition of all young people in every generation,
and in every house&mdash;&ldquo;Will you tell me a story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answer to such a request, often and importunately
repeated, the author has from year to year delighted
in seeing herself surrounded by a circle of joyous, eager
faces, listening with awe to the terrors of Mrs. Crabtree,
or smiling at the frolics of Harry and Laura.
The stories, originally, were so short, that some friends,
aware of their popularity, and conscious of their harmless
tendency, took the trouble of copying them in
manuscript for their own young friends; but the tales
have since grown and expanded during frequent verbal
repetitions, till, with various fanciful additions and
new characters, they have enlarged into their present
form, or rather so far beyond it, that several chapters
are omitted, to keep the volume within moderate compass.</p>

<p>Paley remarks, that &ldquo;any amusement which is innocent,
is better than none; as the writing of a book, the
building of a house, the laying out of a garden, the
digging of a fish-pond, even the raising of a cucumber;&rdquo;
and it is hoped that, while the author herself has
found much interesting occupation in recording these
often repeated stories, the time of herself and her young
readers may be employed with some degree of profit,
or she will certainly regret that it was not better occupied
in the rearing of cucumbers.</p>

<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">Laura</span> and Harry Graham could scarcely feel sure that they
ever had a mama, because she died while they were yet very
young indeed; but Frank, who was some years older, recollected
perfectly well what pretty playthings she used to give
him, and missed his kind, good mama so extremely, that he
one day asked if he might &ldquo;go to a shop and buy a new
mama?&rdquo; Frank often afterwards thought of the time also,
when he kneeled beside her bed to say his prayers, or when
he sat upon her knee to hear funny stories about good boys
and bad boys&mdash;all very interesting, and all told on purpose
to show how much happier obedient children are, than those
who waste their time in idleness and folly. Boys and girls
all think they know the road to happiness without any mistake,
and choose that which looks gayest and pleasantest at
first, though older people, who have travelled that road already,
can tell them that a very difficult path is the only one which
<a name="p0010.png" id="p0010.png" href="#p0010.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>ends agreeably; and those who begin to walk in it when
they are young, will really find that &ldquo;wisdom&#8217;s ways are
ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.&rdquo; It was
truly remarked by Solomon, that &ldquo;even a child is known by
his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be
right.&rdquo; Therefore, though Frank was yet but a little boy,
his friends, who observed how carefully he attended to his
mama&#8217;s instructions, how frequently he studied his Bible,
and how diligently he learned his lessons, all prophesied that
this merry, lively child, with laughing eyes, and dimpled
cheeks, would yet grow up to be a good and useful man;
especially when it became evident that, by the blessing of
God, he had been early turned away from the broad road that
leadeth to destruction, in which every living person would
naturally walk, and led into the narrow path that leadeth to
eternal life.</p>

<p>When his mama, Lady Graham, after a long and painful
illness, was at last taken away to the better world, for which
she had been many years preparing, her only sorrow and
anxiety seemed to be that she left behind her three such very
dear children, who were now to be entirely under the care
of their papa, Sir Edward Graham; and it was with many
prayers and tears that she tried to make her mind more easy
about their future education, and future happiness.</p>

<p>Sir Edward felt such extreme grief on the death of Lady
Graham, that instead of being able to remain at home with
his young family, and to interest his mind as he would wish
to have done, by attending to them, he was ordered by Dr.
Bell, to set off immediately for Paris, Rome, and Naples,
where it was hoped he might leave his distresses behind him
while he travelled, or at all events, forget them.</p>

<p>Luckily the children had a very good, kind uncle, Major
David Graham, and their grandmama, Lady Harriet Graham,
who were both exceedingly happy to take charge of them,
observing that no house could be cheerful without a few little
<a name="p0011.png" id="p0011.png" href="#p0011.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>people being there, and that now they would have constant
amusement in trying to make Frank, Harry, and Laura, as
happy as possible, and even still happier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the thing I am almost afraid of!&rdquo; said Sir Edward,
smiling. &ldquo;Uncles and grandmamas are only too
kind, and my small family will be quite spoiled by indulgence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you leave that old vixen, Mrs. Crabtree, as governor
of the nursery,&rdquo; answered Major Graham, laughing.
&ldquo;She ought to have been the drummer of a regiment, she
is so fond of the rod! I believe there never was such a
tyrant since the time when nursery-maids were invented.
Poor Harry would pass his life in a dark closet, like Baron
Trenck, if Mrs. Crabtree had her own way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She means it all well. I am certain that Mrs. Crabtree
is devotedly fond of my children, and would go through
fire and water to serve them; but she is a little severe perhaps.
Her idea is, that if you never forgive a first fault, you
will never hear of a second, which is probably true enough.
At all events, her harshness will be the best remedy for
your extreme indulgence; therefore let me beg that you
and my mother will seldom interfere with her &lsquo;method,&rsquo; especially
in respect to Harry and Laura. As for Frank, if
all boys were like him, we might make a bonfire of birch
rods and canes. He is too old for nursery discipline now,
and must be flogged at school, if deserving of it at all, till he
goes to sea next year with my friend Gordon, who has promised
to rate him as a volunteer of the first class, on board
the Thunderbolt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s admirable &ldquo;system&rdquo; with
children, Harry and Laura became, from this time, two of
the most heedless, frolicsome beings in the world, and had
to be whipped almost every morning; for in those days it
had not been discovered that whipping is all a mistake, and
that children can be made good without it; though some
<a name="p0012.png" id="p0012.png" href="#p0012.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>old-fashioned people still say&mdash;and such, too, who take the
God of truth for their guide&mdash;the old plan succeeded best,
and those who &ldquo;spare the rod will spoil the child.&rdquo; When
Lady Harriet and Major Graham spoke kindly to Harry and
Laura, about anything wrong that had been done, they both
felt more sad and sorry, than after the severest punishments
of Mrs. Crabtree, who frequently observed, that &ldquo;if those
children were shut up in a dark room alone, with nothing
to do, they would still find some way of being mischievous,
and of deserving to be punished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; said Major Graham one day, &ldquo;you remind
me of a monkey which belonged to the colonel of our regiment
formerly. He was famous for contriving to play all
sorts of pranks when no one supposed them to be possible,
and I recollect once having a valuable French clock, which
the malicious creature seemed particularly determined to
break. Many a time I caught him in the fact, and saved
my beautiful clock; but one day, being suddenly summoned
out of the room, I hastily fastened his chain to a table, so
that he could not possibly, even at the full extent of his paw,
so much as touch the glass case. I observed him impatiently
watching my departure, and felt a misgiving that he
expected to get the better of me; so after shutting the door,
I took a peep through the key-hole, and what do you think
Jack had done, Harry? for, next to Mr. Monkey himself,
you are certainly the cleverest contriver of mischief I
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; asked Harry eagerly; &ldquo;did he
throw a stone at the clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! but his leg was several inches longer than his
arm, so having turned his tail towards his object, he stretched
out his hind-paw, and before I could rush back, my
splendid alabaster clock had been upset and broken to
shivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura soon became quite as mischievous as Harry, which
<a name="p0013.png" id="p0013.png" href="#p0013.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>is very surprising, as she was a whole year older, and had
been twice as often scolded by Mrs. Crabtree. Neither of
these children intended any harm, for they were only heedless
lively romps, who would not for twenty worlds have told
a lie, or done a shabby thing, or taken what did not belong
to them. They were not greedy either, and would not on
any account have resembled Peter Grey, who was at the
same school with Frank, and who spent all his own pocket-money,
and borrowed a great deal of other people&#8217;s, to squander
at the pastry-cook&#8217;s, saying, he wished it were possible
to eat three dinners, and two breakfasts, and five suppers
every day.</p>

<p>Harry was not a cruel boy either; he never lashed his
pony, beat his dog, pinched his sister, or killed any butterflies,
though he often chased them for fun, and one day he
even defended a wasp, at the risk of being stung, when Mrs.
Crabtree intended to kill it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nasty, useless vermin!&rdquo; said she angrily, &ldquo;What business
have they in the world! coming into other people&#8217;s
houses, with nothing to do! They sting and torment every
body! Bees are very different, for they make honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wasps make jelly!&rdquo; said Harry resolutely, while he
opened the window, and shook the happy wasp out of his
pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crabtree allowed no pets of any description in her
territories, and ordered the children to be happy without
any such nonsense. When Laura&#8217;s canary-bird escaped
one unlucky day out of its cage, Mrs. Crabtree was strongly
suspected by Major Graham, of having secretly opened
the door, as she had long declared war upon bulfinches,
white mice, parrots, kittens, dogs, bantams, and gold fish,
observing that animals only made a noise and soiled the
house, therefore every creature should remain in its own
home, &ldquo;birds in the air, fish in the sea, and beasts in the
desert.&rdquo; She seemed always watching in hopes Harry and
<a name="p0014.png" id="p0014.png" href="#p0014.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Laura might do something that they ought to be punished
for; and Mrs. Crabtree certainly had more ears than other
people, or slept with one eye open, as, whatever might be
done, night or day, she overheard the lowest whisper of
mischief, and appeared able to see what was going on in the
dark.</p>

<p>When Harry was a very little boy, he sometimes put
himself in the corner, after doing wrong, apparently
quite sensible that he deserved to be punished, and
once, after being terribly scolded by Mrs. Crabtree, he drew
in his stool beside her chair, with a funny penitent face,
twirling his thumbs over and over each other, and saying,
&ldquo;Now, Mrs. Crabtree! look what a good boy I am going
to be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You a good boy!&rdquo; replied she contemptuously: &ldquo;No!
no! the world will be turned into a cream-cheese first!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Harriet gave Harry and Laura a closet of their own,
in which she allowed them to keep their toys, and nobody
could help laughing to see that, amidst the whole collection,
there was seldom one unbroken. Frank wrote out a list
once of what he found in this crowded little store-room, and
amused himself often with reading it over afterwards. There
were three dolls without faces, a horse with no legs, a drum
with a hole in the top, a cart without wheels, a churn with
no bottom, a kite without a tale, a skipping-rope with no
handles, and a cup and ball that had lost the string. Lady
Harriet called this closet the hospital for decayed toys, and
she often employed herself as their doctor, mending legs
and arms for soldiers, horses, and dolls, though her skill
seldom succeeded long, because play-things must have been
made of cast-iron to last a week with Harry. One cold
winter morning when Laura entered the nursery, she found
a large fire blazing, and all her wax dolls sitting in a row
within the fender staring at the flames. Harry intended no
mischief on this occasion, but great was his vexation when
<a name="p0015.png" id="p0015.png" href="#p0015.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Laura burst into tears, and showed him that their faces were
running in a hot stream down upon their beautiful silk
frocks, which were completely ruined, and not a doll had
its nose remaining. Another time, Harry pricked a hole
in his own beautiful large gas ball, wishing to see how the
gas could possibly escape, after which, in a moment, it shrivelled
up into a useless empty bladder,&mdash;and when his kite
was flying up to the clouds, Harry often wished that he
could be tied to the tail himself, so as to fly also through the
air like a bird, and see every thing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crabtree always wore a prodigious bunch of jingling
keys in her pocket, that rung whenever she moved, as if
she carried a dinner bell in her pocket, and Frank said it
was like a rattlesnake giving warning of her approach,
which was of great use, as everybody had time to put on
a look of good behaviour before she arrived. Even Betty,
the under nursery-maid, felt in terror of Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s
entrance, and was obliged to work harder than any six
house-maids united. Frank told her one day that he thought
brooms might soon be invented, which would go by steam
and brush carpets of themselves, but, in the meantime, not a
grain of dust could lurk in any corner of the nursery without
being dislodged. Betty would have required ten hands,
and twenty pair of feet, to do all the work that was expected;
but the grate looked like jet, the windows would not
have soiled a cambric handkerchief, and the carpet was
switched with so many tea-leaves, that Frank thought Mrs.
Crabtree often took several additional cups of tea in order
to leave a plentiful supply of leaves for sweeping the floor
next morning.</p>

<p>If Laura and Harry left any breakfast, Mrs. Crabtree
kept it carefully till dinner time, when they were obliged to
finish the whole before tasting meat; and if they refused it
at dinner, the remains were kept for supper. Mrs. Crabtree
always informed them that she did it &ldquo;for their good,&rdquo;
<a name="p0016.png" id="p0016.png" href="#p0016.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>though Harry never could see any good that it did to either
of them; and when she mentioned how many poor children
would be glad to eat what they despised, he often wished
the hungry beggars had some of his own hot dinner, which
he would gladly have spared to them; for Harry was really
so generous, that he would have lived upon air, if he might
be of use to anybody. Time passed on, and Lady Harriet
engaged a master for some hours a-day to teach the children
lessons, while even Mrs. Crabtree found no other fault to
Harry and Laura, except that in respect to good behaviour
their memories were like a sieve, which let out every thing
they were desired to keep in mind. They seemed always
to hope, somehow or other, when Mrs. Crabtree once
turned her back, she would never shew her face again; so
their promises of better conduct were all &ldquo;wind without
rain,&rdquo;&mdash;very loud and plenty of them, but no good effect to
be seen afterwards.</p>

<p>Among her many other torments, Mrs. Crabtree rolled
up Laura&#8217;s hair every night on all sides of her head, in
large stiff curl-papers, till they were as round and hard as
walnuts, after which, she tied on a night-cap, as tightly as
possible above all, saying this would curl the hair still better.
Laura could not lay any part of her head on the pillow,
without suffering so much pain that, night after night, she
sat up in bed, after Mrs. Crabtree had bustled out of the
room, and quietly took the cruel papers out, though she was
punished so severely for doing so, that she obeyed orders at
last and lay wide awake half the night with torture; and it
was but small comfort to Laura afterwards, that Lady Harriet&#8217;s
visitors frequently admired the forest of long glossy
ringlets that adorned her head, and complimented Mrs.
Crabtree on the trouble it must cost her to keep that charming
hair in order. Often did Laura wish that it were ornamenting
any wig-block, rather than her own head; and
one day Lady Harriet laughed heartily, when some strangers
<a name="p0017.png" id="p0017.png" href="#p0017.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>admired her little grand-daughter&#8217;s ringlets, and Laura
asked, very anxiously, if they would like to cut off a few of
the longest, and keep them for her sake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your hair does curl like a cork-screw,&rdquo; said Frank,
laughing. &ldquo;If I want to draw a cork out of a beer bottle
any day, I shall borrow one of those ringlets, Laura!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may laugh, Frank, for it is fun to you and death
to me,&rdquo; answered poor Laura, gravely shaking her curls at
him. &ldquo;I wish we were all bald, like uncle David! During
the night, I cannot lie still on account of those tiresome
curls, and all day I dare not stir for fear of spoiling them,
so they are never out of my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor off your head! How pleasant it must be to have
Mrs. Crabtree combing and scolding, and scolding and
combing, for hours every day! Poor Laura! we must get
Dr. Bell to say that they shall be taken off on pain of death,
and then, perhaps, grandmama would order some Irish
reapers to cut them down with a sickle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank! what a lucky boy you are to be at school, and
not in the nursery! I wish next year would come immediately,
for then I shall have a governess, after which good-bye
to Mrs. Crabtree, and the wearisome curl-papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t like school!&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;It is perfect nonsense
to plague me with lessons now. All big people can
read and write, so, of course, I shall be able to do like
others. There is no hurry about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never was there a more amiable, pious, excellent boy
than Frank, who read his Bible so attentively, and said his
prayers so regularly every morning and evening, that he
soon learned both to know his duty and to do it. Though
he laughed heartily at the scrapes which Harry and Laura
so constantly fell into, he often also helped them out of
their difficulties; being very different from most elderly
boys, who find an odd kind of pleasure in teazing younger
children&mdash;pulling their hair&mdash;pinching their arms&mdash;twitching
<a name="p0018.png" id="p0018.png" href="#p0018.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>away their dinners&mdash;and twenty more plans for tormenting,
which Frank never attempted to enjoy, but he
often gave Harry and Laura a great deal of kind, sober,
good advice, which they listened to very attentively while
they were in any new distress, but generally forgot again
as soon as their spirits rose. Frank came home only upon
Saturdays and Sundays, because he attended during most
of the week at Mr. Lexicon&#8217;s academy, where he gradually
became so clever, that the masters all praised his extraordinary
attention, and covered him with medals, while Major
Graham often filled his pockets with a reward of money,
after which he ran towards the nearest shop to spend his
little fortune in buying a present for somebody. Frank
scarcely ever wanted anything for himself, but he always
wished to contrive some kind generous plan for other people;
and Major Graham used to say, &ldquo;if that boy had only
sixpence in the world, he would lay it all out on penny
tarts to distribute among half-a-dozen of his friends.&rdquo; He
even saved his pocket-money once, during three whole
months, to purchase a gown for Mrs. Crabtree, who looked
almost good-humoured during the space of five minutes,
when Frank presented it to her, saying, in his joyous merry
voice, &ldquo;Mrs. Crabtree! I wish you health to wear it,
strength to tear it, and money to buy another!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Certainly there never was such a gown before! It had
been chosen by Frank and Harry together, who thought
nothing could be more perfect. The colour was so bright
an apple-green, that it would have put any body&#8217;s teeth on
edge to look at it, and the whole was dotted over with large
round spots of every colour, as if a box of wafers had been
showered upon the surface. Laura wished Mrs. Crabtree
might receive a present every day, as it put her in such
good-humour, and nearly three weeks after passed this,
without a single scold being heard in the nursery; so
<a name="p0019.png" id="p0019.png" href="#p0019.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Frank observed that he thought Mrs. Crabtree would soon
be quite out of practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura!&rdquo; said Major Graham, looking very sly one
morning, &ldquo;have you heard all the new rules that Mrs.
Crabtree has made?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied she in great alarm; &ldquo;what are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, you are positively not to tear and destroy
above three frocks a-day; secondly, you and Harry
must never get into a passion, unless you are angry; thirdly,
when either of you take medicine, you are not to
make wry faces, except when the taste is bad; fourthly,
you must never speak ill of Mrs. Crabtree herself, until she
is out of the room; fifthly, you are not to jump out of the
windows, as long as you can get out at the <span class="nw">door&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; interrupted Laura, laughing, &ldquo;and sixthly,
when uncle David is joking, we are not to be frightened by
anything he says!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seventhly, when next you spill grandmama&#8217;s bottle
of ink, Harry must drink up every drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well! he may swallow a sheet of blotting paper
afterwards, to put away the taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish every body who writes a book, was obliged to
swallow it,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;It is such a waste of time
reading, when we might be amusing ourselves. Frank
sat mooning over a book for two hours yesterday when we
wanted him to play. I am sure, some day his head will
burst with knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;That can never happen to you, Master Harry,&rdquo; answered
Major Graham; &ldquo;you have a head, and so has a pin,
but there is not much furniture in either of them.&rdquo;</p>

<div>She whipp&#8217;d them all soundly, and sent them to bed.</div>
</div>
<p class="rt sc">Nursery Rhymes.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">Lady</span> Harriet Graham was an extremely thin, delicate, old
lady, with a very pale face, and a sweet gentle voice, which
the children delighted to hear, for it always spoke kindly to
them, and sounded like music, after the loud, rough tones
of Mrs. Crabtree. She wore her own grey hair, which had
become almost as white as the widow&#8217;s cap which covered
her head. The rest of her dress was generally black velvet,
and she usually sat in a comfortable arm-chair by the fire-side,
watching her grandchildren at play, with a large work-bag
by her side, and a prodigious Bible open on the table
before her. Lady Harriet often said that it made her
young again to see the joyous gambols of Harry and Laura;
and when unable any longer to bear their noise, she
sometimes kept them quiet, by telling the most delightful
stories about what had happened to herself when she was
young.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, however, Lady Harriet suddenly
became so very ill, that Dr. Bell said she must spend
a few days in the country, for change of air, and accordingly
she determined on passing a quiet week at Holiday
<a name="p0021.png" id="p0021.png" href="#p0021.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>House with her relations, Lord and Lady Rockville.
Meanwhile, Harry and Laura were to be left under the sole
care of Mrs. Crabtree, so it might have been expected that
they would both feel more frightened for her, now that she
was reigning monarch of the house, than ever. Harry
would obey those he loved, if they only held up a little
finger; but all the terrors of Mrs. Crabtree, and her cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails,
were generally forgotten soon after she left the
room; therefore he thought little at first about the many
threats she held out, if he behaved ill, but he listened most
seriously when his dear sick grandmama told him, in a
faint weak voice, on the day of her departure from home,
how very well he ought to behave in her absence, as no one
remained but the maids to keep him in order, and that she
hoped Mrs. Crabtree would write her a letter full of good
news about his excellent conduct.</p>

<p>Harry felt as if he would gladly sit still without stirring,
till his grandmama came back, if that could only please
her; and there never was any one more determined to be a
good boy than he, at the moment when Lady Harriet&#8217;s carriage
came round to the door. Laura, Frank, and Harry helped
to carry all the pillows, boxes, books, and baskets which
were necessary for the journey, of which there seemed to be
about fifty; then they arranged the cushions as comfortably
as possible, and watched very sorrowfully when their grandmama,
after kindly embracing them both, was carefully supported
by Major Graham and her maid Harrison, into the
chariot. Uncle David gave each of the children a pretty picture-book
before taking leave, and said, as he was stepping
into the carriage, &ldquo;Now, children! I have only one piece
of serious, important advice to give you all, so attend to me!&mdash;never
crack nuts with your teeth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the carriage had driven off, Mrs. Crabtree became
so busy scolding Betty, and storming at Jack the foot-boy,
for not cleaning her shoes well enough, that she left Harry
<a name="p0022.png" id="p0022.png" href="#p0022.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and Laura standing in the passage, not knowing exactly
what they ought to do first, and Frank, seeing them looking
rather melancholy and bewildered at the loss of their grandmama,
stopped a moment as he passed on the way to school,
and said in a very kind, affectionate voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Harry and Laura, listen both of you!&mdash;here is a
grand opportunity to show everybody, that we can be trusted
to ourselves, without getting into any scrapes, so that if
grandmama is ever ill again, and obliged to go away, she
need not feel so sad and anxious as she did to-day. I mean
to become nine times more attentive to my lessons than
usual this morning, to show how trust-worthy we are, and
if you are wise, pray march straight up to the nursery yourselves.
I have arranged a gown and cap of Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s
on the large arm-chair, to look as like herself as possible,
that you may be reminded how soon she will come back,
and you must not behave like the mice when the cat is out.
Good bye! Say the alphabet backward, and count your fingers
for half-an-hour, but when Mrs. Crabtree appears again,
pray do not jump out of the window for joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura were proceeding directly towards the
nursery, as Frank had recommended, when unluckily they
observed in passing the drawing-room door, that it was wide
open; so Harry peeped in, and they began idly wandering
round the tables and cabinets. Not ten minutes elapsed
before they both commenced racing about as if they were
mad, perfectly screaming with joy, and laughing so loudly
at their own funny tricks, that an old gentleman who lived
next door, very nearly sent in a message to ask what the
joke was.</p>

<p>Presently Harry and Laura ran up and down stairs till
the housemaid was quite fatigued with running after them.
They jumped upon the fine damask sofas in the drawing-room,
stirred the fire till it was in a blaze, and rushed out
on the balcony, upsetting one or two geraniums and a myrtle.
<a name="p0023.png" id="p0023.png" href="#p0023.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">23</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>They spilt Lady Harriet&#8217;s perfumes over their handkerchiefs,&mdash;they
looked into all the beautiful books of pictures,&mdash;they
tumbled many of the pretty Dresden china
figures on the floor,&mdash;they wound up the little French clock
till it was broken,&mdash;they made the musical work-box play
its tunes, and set the Chinese mandarins nodding, till they
very nearly nodded their heads off. In short, so much mischief
has seldom been done in so short a time, till at last
Harry, perfectly worn out with laughing and running, threw
himself into a large arm-chair, and Laura, with her ringlets
tumbling in frightful confusion over her face, and the beads
of her coral necklace rolling on the floor, tossed herself into
a sofa beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! what fun!&rdquo; cried Harry, in an ecstacy of delight;
&ldquo;I wish Frank had been here, and crowds of little boys and
girls, to play with us all day! It would be a good joke,
Laura, to write and ask all our little cousins and companions
to drink tea here to-morrow evening! Their mamas
could never guess we had not leave from grandmama to invite
everybody, so I dare say we might gather quite a large
party! oh! how enchanting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura laughed heartily when she heard this proposal of
Harry&#8217;s, and without hesitating a moment about it, she joyously
placed herself before Lady Harriet&#8217;s writing-table, and
scribbled a multitude of little notes, in large text, to more
than twenty young friends, all of whom had at other times
been asked by Lady Harriet to spend the evening with her.</p>

<p>Laura felt very much puzzled to know what was usually
said in a card of invitation, but after many consultations,
she and Harry thought at last, that it was very nicely expressed,
for they wrote these words upon a large sheet of
paper to each of their <span class="nw">friends:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="nobot">Master Harry Graham and Miss Laura wish you to have
the honour of drinking tea with us to-morrow, at six o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p class="rt padr">
(Signed) <span class="sc">Harry</span> and <span class="sc">Laura</span>.</p>

<p><a name="p0024.png" id="p0024.png" href="#p0024.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>Laura afterwards singed a hole in her muslin frock, while
lighting one of the Vesta matches to seal these numerous
notes; and Harry dropped some burning sealing-wax on
his hand, in the hurry of assisting her; but he thought that
little accident no matter, and ran away to see if the cards
could be sent off immediately.</p>

<p>Now, there lived in the house a very old footman, called
Andrew, who remembered Harry and Laura since they were
quite little babies; and he often looked exceedingly sad and
sorry when they suffered punishment from Mrs. Crabtree.
He was ready to do anything in the world when it pleased
the children, and would have carried a message to the moon,
if they had only shown him the way. Many odd jobs and
private messages he had already been employed in by Harry,
who now called Andrew up stairs, entreating him to carry
out all those absurd notes as fast as possible, and to deliver
them immediately, as they were of the greatest consequence.
Upon hearing this, old Andrew lost not a moment,
but threw on his hat, and instantly started off, looking like
the twopenny postman, he carried such a prodigious parcel
of invitations, while Harry and Laura stood at the drawing-room
window, almost screaming with joy when they saw
him set out, and when they observed that, to oblige them,
he actually ran along the street at a sort of trot, which was
as fast as he could possibly go. Presently, however, he
certainly did stop for a single minute, and Laura saw that
it was in order to take a peep into one of the notes, that he
might ascertain what they were all about; but as he never
carried any letters without doing so, she thought that quite
natural, and was only very glad when he had finished, and
rapidly pursued his way again.</p>

<p>Next morning, Mrs. Crabtree and Betty became very
much surprised to observe what a number of smart livery
servants knocked at the street door, and gave in cards, but
their astonishment became still greater, when old Andrew
<a name="p0025.png" id="p0025.png" href="#p0025.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">25</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>brought up a whole parcel of them to Harry and Laura, who
immediately broke the seals, and read the contents in a corner
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you about there, Master Graham?&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Crabtree, angrily, &ldquo;how dare any body venture to
touch your grandmama&#8217;s letters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not for grandmama!&mdash;they are all for us!&mdash;every
one of them!&rdquo; answered Harry, dancing about the
room with joy, and waving the notes over his head. &ldquo;Look
at this direction! For Master and Miss Graham! put on
your spectacles, and read it yourself, Mrs. Crabtree! What
delightful fun! the house will be as full as an egg!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crabtree seemed completely puzzled what to think
of all this, and looked so much as if she did not know exactly
what to be angry at, and so ready to be in a passion if
possible, that Harry burst out a laughing, while he said,
&ldquo;Only think Mrs. Crabtree! here is every body coming to tea
with us!&mdash;all my cousins, besides Peter Grey, Robert Stewart,
Charles Forrester, Adelaide Cunninghame, Diana
Wentworth, John Fordyce, Edmund Ashford, Frank Abercromby,
Ned Russel, and Tom <span class="nw">&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy is distracted!&rdquo; exclaimed Betty, staring with
astonishment. &ldquo;What does all this mean, Master Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who gave you leave to invite company into your
grandmama&#8217;s house?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crabtree, snatching up
all the notes, and angrily thrusting them into the fire. &ldquo;I
never heard of such things in all my life before, Master
Harry! but as sure as eggs is eggs, you shall repent of this,
for not one morsel of cake, or anything else shall you have
to give any of the party; no! not so much as a crust of
bread, or a thimbleful of tea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura had never thought of such a catastrophe
as this before; they always saw a great table covered
with every thing that could be named for tea, whenever
their little friends came to visit them, and whether it rose
<a name="p0026.png" id="p0026.png" href="#p0026.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>out of the floor, or was brought by Aladdin&#8217;s lamp, they
never considered it possible that the table would not be
provided as usual on such occasions, so this terrible speech
of Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s frightened them out of their wits. What
was to be done! They both knew by experience that she
always did whatever she threatened, or something a great deal
worse, so they began by bursting into tears, and begging
Mrs. Crabtree for this once to excuse them, and to give
some cakes and tea to their little visitors, but they might as
well have spoken to one of the Chinese mandarins, for she
only shook her head, with a positive look, declaring over
and over again that nothing should appear upon the table
except what was always brought up for their own supper&mdash;two
biscuits and two cups of milk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore say no more about it!&rdquo; added she, sternly.
&ldquo;I am your best friend, Master Harry, trying to teach you
and Miss Laura your duty, so save your breath to cool your
porridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Harry and Laura looked perfectly ill with fright and
vexation when they thought of what was to happen next,
while Mrs. Crabtree sat down to her knitting, grumbling to
herself, and dropping her stitches every minute with rage
and irritation. Old Andrew felt exceedingly sorry after he
heard what distress and difficulty Harry was in, and when
the hour for the party approached, he very good-naturedly
spread out a large table in the dining-room, where he put
down as many cups, saucers, plates, and spoons as Laura
chose to direct; but in spite of all his trouble, though it
looked very grand, there was nothing whatever to eat or
drink, except the two dry biscuits, and the two miserable
cups of milk, which seemed to become smaller every time
that Harry looked at them.</p>

<p>Presently the clock struck six, and Harry listened to the
hour very much as a prisoner would do in the condemned
cell in Newgate, feeling that the dreaded time was at last
<a name="p0027.png" id="p0027.png" href="#p0027.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>arrived. Soon afterwards, several handsome carriages
drove up to the door filled with little Masters and Misses,
who hurried joyfully into the house, talking and laughing
all the way up stairs, being evidently quite happy at coming
out to tea, while poor Harry and Laura almost wished the
floor would open and swallow them up, so they shrunk into
a distant corner of the room, quite ashamed to show their
faces.</p>

<p>The young ladies were all dressed in their best frocks,
with pink sashes, and pink shoes; while the little boys
appeared in their holiday clothes, with their hair newly
brushed, and their faces washed. The whole party had dined
at two o&#8217;clock, so they were as hungry as hawks, looking
eagerly round, whenever they entered, to see what was on
the tea-table, and evidently surprised that nothing had yet
been put down. Laura and Harry soon afterwards heard
their visitors whispering to each other about Norwich buns,
rice cakes, spunge biscuits, and maccaroons; while Peter
Grey was loud in praise of a party at George Lorraine&#8217;s
the night before, where an immense plum-cake had been
sugared over like a snow storm, and covered with crowds
of beautiful amusing mottoes; not to mention a quantity
of noisy crackers, that exploded like pistols; besides
which, a glass of hot jelly had been handed to each little
guest before he was sent home.</p>

<p>Every time the door opened, all eyes were anxiously
turned round, expecting a grand feast to be brought in; but
quite the contrary&mdash;it was only Andrew showing up more
hungry visitors; while Harry felt so unspeakably wretched,
that, if some kind fairy could only have turned him into a
Norwich bun at the moment, he would gladly have consented
to be cut in pieces, that his ravenous guests might be
satisfied.</p>

<p>Charles Forrester was a particularly good-natured boy,
so Harry at last took courage and beckoned him into a
<a name="p0028.png" id="p0028.png" href="#p0028.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>remote corner of the room, where he confessed, in whispers,
the real state of affairs about tea, and how sadly distressed
he and Laura felt, because they had nothing whatever to
give among so many visitors, seeing that Mrs. Crabtree
kept her determination of affording them no provisions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to be done!&rdquo; said Charles, very anxiously, as
he felt extremely sorry for his little friends. &ldquo;If Mama
had been at home, she would gladly have sent whatever you
liked for tea, but unluckily she is dining out! I saw a loaf
of bread lying on a table at home this evening, which she
would make you quite welcome to! Shall I run home, as
fast as possible, to fetch it? That would, at any rate, be
better than nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Charles Forrester was very lame, therefore, while
he talked of running he could hardly walk, but Lady Forrester&#8217;s
house stood so near, that he soon reached home,
when, snatching up the loaf, he hurried back towards the
street with his prize, quite delighted to see how large and
substantial it looked. Scarcely had he reached the door,
however, before the housekeeper ran hastily out, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, Mr. Charles! stop! sure you are not running
away with the loaf for my tea, and the parrot must have
her supper too. What do you want with that there bread?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Mrs. Comfit!&rdquo; answered Charles, hastening
on faster than ever, while he grasped the precious loaf
more firmly in his hand, and limped along at a prodigious
rate, &ldquo;Polly is getting too fat, so she will be the better of
fasting for this one day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Comfit, being enormously fat herself, became very
angry at this remark, so she seemed quite desperate to recover
the loaf, and hurried forward to overtake Charles, but
the old housekeeper was so heavy and breathless, while the
young gentleman was so lame, that it seemed an even
chance which won the race. Harry stood at his own door,
impatiently hoping to receive the prize, and eagerly stretched
<a name="p0029.png" id="p0029.png" href="#p0029.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>out his arms to encourage his friend, while it was impossible
to say which of the runners might arrive first. Harry
had sometimes heard of a race between two old women tied
up in sacks, and he thought they could scarcely move with
more difficulty; but at the very moment when Charles had
reached the door, he stumbled over a stone, and fell on the
ground. Mrs. Comfit then instantly rushed up, and seizing
the loaf, she carried it off in triumph, leaving the two little
friends ready to cry with vexation, and quite at a loss what
plan to attempt next.</p>

<p>Mean time, a sad riot had arisen in the dining-room,
where the boys called loudly for their tea; and the young
ladies drew their chairs all round the table, to wait till it was
ready. Still nothing appeared; so every body wondered
more and more how long they were to wait for all the nice
cakes and sweetmeats which must, of course, be coming;
for the longer they were delayed, the more was expected.</p>

<p>The last at a feast, and the first at a fray, was generally
Peter Grey, who now lost patience, and seized one of the
two biscuits, which he was in the middle of greedily devouring,
when Laura returned with Harry to the dining-room,
and observed what he had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter Grey!&rdquo; said she, holding up her head, and trying
to look very dignified, &ldquo;you are an exceedingly naughty
boy, to help yourself! As a punishment for being so
rude, you shall have nothing more to eat all this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do not help myself, nobody else seems likely to
give me any supper! I appear to be the only person who
is to taste anything to-night,&rdquo; answered Peter, laughing,
while the impudent boy took a cup of milk, and drank it
off, saying, &ldquo;Here&#8217;s to your very good health, Miss Laura,
and an excellent appetite to everybody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon hearing this absurd speech, all the other boys began
laughing, and made signs, as if they were eating their
fingers off with hunger. Then Peter called Lady Harriet&#8217;s
<a name="p0030.png" id="p0030.png" href="#p0030.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>house &ldquo;Famine Castle,&rdquo; and pretended he would swallow
the knives like an Indian juggler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must learn to live upon air, and here are some
spoons to eat it with,&rdquo; said John Fordyce. &ldquo;Harry! shall
I help you to a mouthful of moonshine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter! would you like a roasted fly?&rdquo; asked Frank
Abercromby, catching one on the window. &ldquo;I dare say it
is excellent for hungry people,&mdash;or a slice of buttered wall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a stewed spider?&rdquo; asked Peter. &ldquo;Shall we all be
cannibals, and eat one another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the use of all those forks, when there is nothing
to stick upon them?&rdquo; asked George Maxwell, throwing
them about on the floor. &ldquo;No buns!&mdash;no fruit!&mdash;no
cakes!&mdash;no nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we to do with those tea-cups, when there is
no tea?&rdquo; cried Frank Abercromby, pulling the table-cloth
till the whole affair fell prostrate on the floor. After this,
these riotous boys tossed the plates up in the air, and caught
them, becoming, at last, so outrageous, that poor old
Andrew called them a &ldquo;meal mob.&rdquo; Never was there
so much broken china seen in a dining-room before! It
all lay scattered on the floor, in countless fragments, looking
as if there had been a bull in a china shop, when suddenly
Mrs. Crabtree herself opened the door and walked in, with
an aspect of rage enough to petrify a milestone. Now old
Andrew had long been trying all in his power to render the
boys quiet and contented. He had made them a speech,&mdash;he
had chased the ring-leaders all round the room,&mdash;and he
had thrown his stick at Peter, who seemed the most riotous,&mdash;but
all in vain; they became worse and worse, laughing
into fits, and calling Andrew &ldquo;the police-officer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
bailiff.&rdquo; It was a very different story, however, when Mrs.
Crabtree appeared, so flaming with fury, she might have
blown up a powder-mill.</p>

<p>Nobody could help being afraid of her. Even Peter
<a name="p0031.png" id="p0031.png" href="#p0031.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>himself stood stock-still, and seemed withering away to nothing,
when she looked at him; and when she began to scold
in her most furious manner, not a boy ventured to look off
the ground. A large pair of tawse then became visible in
her hand, so every heart sunk with fright, and the riotous
visitors began to get behind each other, and to huddle out
of sight as much as possible, whispering and pushing, and
fighting, in a desperate scuffle to escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is all this!&rdquo; cried she, at the full pitch of her
voice, &ldquo;has bedlam broke loose! who smashed these cups?
I&#8217;ll break his head for him, let me tell you that! Master
Peter! you should be hissed out of the world for your misconduct;
but I shall certainly whip you round the room
like a whipping-top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, Peter observed that the dining-room
window, which was only about six feet from the ground,
had been left wide open, so instantly seizing the opportunity,
he threw himself out with a single bound, and ran
laughing away. All the other boys immediately followed
his example, and disappeared by the same road; after
which, Mrs. Crabtree leaned far out of the window, and
scolded loudly, as long as they remained in sight, till her
face became red, and her voice perfectly hoarse.</p>

<p>Meantime, the little misses sat soberly down before the
empty table, and talked in whispers to each other, waiting
till their maids came to take them home, after which they
all hurried away as fast as possible, hardly waiting to say
&ldquo;good bye,&rdquo; and intending to ask for some supper at home.</p>

<p>During that night, long after Harry and Laura had been
scolded, whipped, and put to bed, they were each heard in
different rooms, sobbing and crying, as if their very hearts
would break, while Mrs. Crabtree grumbled and scolded to
herself, saying she must do her duty, and make them good
children, though she were to flay them alive first.</p>

<p>When Lady Harriet returned home some days afterwards,
<a name="p0032.png" id="p0032.png" href="#p0032.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>she heard an account of Harry and Laura&#8217;s misconduct from
Mrs. Crabtree, and the whole story was such a terrible case
against them, that their poor grandmama became perfectly
astonished and shocked, while even uncle David was preparing
to be very angry; but before the culprits appeared,
Frank most kindly stepped forward, and begged that they
might be pardoned for this once, adding all in his power to
excuse Harry and Laura, by describing how very penitent
they had become, and how very severely they had already
been punished.</p>

<p>Frank then mentioned all that Harry had told him about
the starving party, which he related with so much humour
and drollery, that Lady Harriet could not help laughing;
so then he saw that a victory had been gained, and ran to
the nursery for the two little prisoners.</p>

<p>Uncle David shook his walking-stick at them, and made
a terrible face, when they entered; but Harry jumped upon
his knee with joy at seeing him again, while Laura forgot
all her distress, and rushed up to Lady Harriet, who folded
her in her arms, and kissed her most affectionately.</p>

<p>Not a word was said that day about the tea-party, but next
morning, Major Graham asked Harry, very gravely, &ldquo;if he
had read in the newspapers the melancholy accounts about
several of his little companions, who were ill and confined
to bed from having ate too much at a certain tea-party on
Saturday last. Poor Peter Grey has been given over, and
Charles Forrester, it is feared, may not be able to eat another
loaf of bread for a fortnight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! uncle David! it makes me ill whenever I think of
that party!&rdquo; said Harry, colouring perfectly scarlet; &ldquo;that
was the most miserable evening of my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say it was not quite fair in Mrs. Crabtree to
starve all the strange little boys and girls, who came as visitors
to my house, without knowing who had invited them,&rdquo;
observed Lady Harriet. &ldquo;Probably those unlucky children
<a name="p0033.png" id="p0033.png" href="#p0033.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>will never forget, as long as they live, that scanty supper in
our dining-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="nobot">And it turned out exactly as Lady Harriet had predicted;
for though they were all asked to tea, in proper time, the
very next Saturday, when Major Graham showered torrents
of sugar-plums on the table, while the children scrambled to
pick them up, and the side-board almost broke down afterwards
under the weight of buns, cakes, cheesecakes, biscuits,
fruit, and preserves, which were heaped upon each other&mdash;yet,
for years afterwards, Peter Grey, whenever he ate a
particularly enormous dinner, always observed, that he must
make up for having once been starved at Harry Graham&#8217;s;
and whenever any one of those little boys or girls again
happened to meet Harry or Laura, they were sure to laugh
and say, &ldquo;When are you going to give us another</p>

<p class="ctr pgbrk">&ldquo;<span class="allsc">GRAND FEAST</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div>Fire rages with fury wherever it comes,</div>
<div>If only one spark should be dropped;</div>
<div>Whole houses, or cities, sometimes it consumes,</div>
<div>Where its violence cannot be stopped.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">One</span> night, about eight o&#8217;clock, Harry and Laura were playing
in the nursery, building houses with bricks, and trying
who could raise the highest tower without letting it fall,
when suddenly they were startled to hear every bell in the
house ringing violently, while the servants seemed running
up and down stairs, as if they were distracted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can be the matter!&rdquo; cried Laura, turning round
and listening, while Harry quietly took this opportunity to
shake the walls of her castle till it fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very house is coming down about your ears, Laura!&rdquo;
said Harry, enjoying his little bit of mischief. &ldquo;I
should like to be Andrew, now, for five minutes, that I might
answer those fifty bells, and see what has happened. Uncle
David must be wanting coals, candles, tea, toast, and soda
water, all at once! What a bustle everybody is in! There!
the bells are ringing again, worse than ever! Something
wonderful is going on! what can it be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently Betty ran breathlessly into the room, saying
that Mrs. Crabtree ought to come down stairs immediately,
as Lady Harriet had been suddenly taken very ill, and, till
<a name="p0035.png" id="p0035.png" href="#p0035.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>the Doctor arrived, nobody knew what to do, so she must
give her advice and assistance.</p>

<p>Harry<!-- original reads "Hary" --> and Laura felt excessively shocked to hear this
alarming news, and listened with grave attention, while Mrs.
Crabtree told them how amazingly well they ought to behave
in her absence, when they were trusted alone in the nursery,
with nobody to keep them in order, or to see what they were
doing, especially now, as their grandmama had been taken
ill, and would require to be kept quiet.</p>

<p>Harry sat in his chair, and might have been painted as
the very picture of a good boy during nearly twenty minutes
after Mrs. Crabtree departed; and Laura placed herself opposite
to him, trying to follow so excellent an example,
while they scarcely spoke above a whisper, wondering what
could be the matter with their grandmama, and wishing for
once, to see Mrs. Crabtree again, that they might hear how
she was. Any one who had observed Harry and Laura at
that time, would have wondered to see two such quiet, excellent,
respectable children, and wished that all little boys
and girls were made upon the same pattern; but presently
they began to think that probably Lady Harriet was not so
very ill, as no more bells had rung during several minutes,
and Harry ventured to look about for some better amusement
than sitting still.</p>

<p>At this moment Laura unluckily perceived on the table
near where they sat, a pair of Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s best scissors,
which she had been positively forbid to touch. The long
troublesome ringlets were as usual hanging over her eyes
in a most teazing manner, so she thought what a good opportunity
this might be to shorten them a very little, not
above an inch or two; and without considering a moment
longer, she slipped upon tiptoe, with a frightened look,
round the table, and picked up the scissors in her hand, then
hastening towards a looking-glass, she began snipping off
the ends of her hair. Laura was much diverted to see it
<a name="p0036.png" id="p0036.png" href="#p0036.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>showering down upon the floor, so she cut and cut on, while
the curls fell thicker and faster, till at last the whole floor
was covered with them, and scarcely a hair left upon her
head. Harry went into fits of laughing when he perceived
what a ridiculous figure Laura had made of herself, and he
turned her round and round to see the havoc she had made,
saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should give all this hair to Mr. Mills the upholsterer,
to stuff grandmama&#8217;s arm-chair with! At any rate,
Laura, if Mrs. Crabtree is ever so angry, she can hardly
pull you by the hair of the head again! What a sound sleep
you will have to-night, with no hard curl-papers to torment
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry had been told five hundred times, never to touch
the candles, and threatened with twenty different punishments,
if he ever ventured to do so; but now, he amused
himself with trying to snuff one till he snuffed it out. Then
he lighted it again, and tried the experiment once more,
but again the teazing candle went out, as if on purpose to
plague him, so he felt quite provoked. Having lighted it
once more, Harry prepared to carry the candlestick with
him towards the inner nursery, though afraid to make the
smallest noise, in case it might be taken from him. Before
he had gone five steps, down dropped the extinguisher,
then followed the snuffers with a great crash, but Laura
seemed too busy cropping her ringlets, to notice what was
going on. All the way along upon the floor, Harry let fall
a perfect shower of hot wax, which spotted the nursery carpet
from the table where he had found the candle into the
next room, where he disappeared, and shut the door, that no
one might interfere with what he liked to do.</p>

<p>After he had been absent some time, the door was hastily
opened again, and Laura felt surprised to see Harry come
back with his face as red as a stick of sealing-wax, and his
<a name="p0037.png" id="p0037.png" href="#p0037.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>large eyes staring wider than they had ever stared before,
with a look of rueful consternation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura in a terrified
voice. &ldquo;Has anything dreadful happened? Why do you
look so frightened and so surprised?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear! what shall I do?&rdquo; cried Harry,
who seemed scarcely to know how he spoke, or where he
was. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know what to do, Laura!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can be the matter! do tell me at once, Harry,&rdquo;
said Laura, shaking with apprehension. &ldquo;Speak as fast as
you can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not tell Mrs. Crabtree, nor grandmama, nor
anybody else?&rdquo; cried Harry, bursting into tears. &ldquo;I am
so very, very sorry, and so frightened! Laura! do you
know, I took a candle into the next room, merely to play
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! go on, Harry! go on! what did you do with the
candle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only put it on the bed for a single minute, to see how
the flame would look there,&mdash;well! do you know it blazed
away famously, and then all the bed clothes began burning
too! Oh! there is such a terrible fire in the next room!
you never saw anything like it! what shall we do? If old
Andrew were to come up, do you think he could put it out?
I have shut the door that Mrs. Crabtree may not see the
flames. Be sure, Laura, to tell nobody but Andrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura became terrified at the way she saw poor Harry in,
but when she opened the door to find out the real state of
affairs, oh! what a dreadful sight was there! all the beds
were on fire, while bright red flames were blazing up to the
roof of the room, with a fierce roaring noise, which it was
perfectly frightful to hear. She screamed aloud with terror
at this alarming scene, while Harry did all he could to quiet
her, and even put his hand over her mouth, that her cries
might not be heard. Laura now struggled to get loose, and
<a name="p0038.png" id="p0038.png" href="#p0038.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>called louder and louder, till at last every maid in the house
came racing up stairs, three steps at a time, to know what
was the matter. Immediately upon seeing the flames, they
all began screaming too, in such a loud discordant way,
that it sounded as if a whole flight of crows had come into
the passages. Never was there such an uproar heard in the
house before, for the walls echoed with a general cry of
&ldquo;Fire! fire! fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up flew Mrs. Crabtree towards the nursery like a sky-rocket,
scolding furiously, talking louder than all the others
put together, and asking who had set the house on fire,
while Harry and Laura scarcely knew whether to be most
frightened for the raging flames, or the raging Mrs. Crabtree;
but, in the meantime, they both shrunk into the
smallest possible size, and hid themselves behind a door.</p>

<p>During all this confusion, Old Andrew luckily remembered,
that, in the morning, there had been a great washing
in the laundry, where large tubs full of water were standing, so
he called to the few maids who had any of their senses remaining,
desiring them to assist in carrying up some
buckets, that they might be emptied on the burning beds, to
extinguish the flames if possible. Every body was now in
a hurry, and all elbowing each other out of the way, while
it was most extraordinary to see how old Andrew exerted
himself, as if he had been a fireman all his life, while Mrs.
Marmalade, the fat cook, who could hardly carry herself up
stairs in general, actively assisted to bring up the great
heavy tubs, and to pour them out like a cascade upon the
burning curtains, till the nursery-floor looked like a duck
pond.</p>

<p>Meantime Harry and Laura added to the confusion as
much as they could, and were busier than anybody, stealing
down the back-stairs whenever Mrs. Crabtree was not in
sight, and filling their little jugs with water, which they
brought up, as fast as possible, and dashed upon the flames,
<a name="p0039.png" id="p0039.png" href="#p0039.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">39</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>till at last, it is to be feared, they began to feel quite amused
with the bustle, and to be almost sorry when the conflagration
diminished. At one time, Laura very nearly set her
own frock on fire, as she ventured too near, but Harry
pulled her back, and then courageously advanced to discharge
a shower from his own little jug, remaining stationary
to watch the effect, till his face was almost scorched.</p>

<p>At last the fire became less and less, till it went totally out,
but not before the nursery furniture had been reduced to perfect
ruins, besides which, Betty had her arm sadly burned in
the confusion. Mrs. Marmalade&#8217;s cap was completely destroyed,
and Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s best gown had so large a hole
burned in the skirt, that she never could wear it again!</p>

<p>After all was quiet, and the fire completely extinguished,
Major Graham took Laura down stairs to Lady Harriet&#8217;s
dressing-room, that she might tell the whole particulars of
how this alarming accident happened in the nursery, for
nobody could guess what had caused so sudden and dreadful
a fire, which seemed to have been as unexpected as a
flash of lightning.</p>

<p>Lady Harriet had felt so terrified by the noise and confusion,
that she was out of bed, sitting up in an arm-chair,
supported by pillows, when Laura entered, at the sight
of whom, with her well-cropped head, she made an exclamation
of perfect amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! who on earth is that! Laura! my dear child!
what has become of all your hair? Were your curls
burned off in the fire? or did the fright make you grow
bald? What is the meaning of all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura turned perfectly crimson with shame and distress,
for she now felt convinced of her own great misconduct
about the scissors and curls, but she had been taught on all
occasions to speak the truth, and would rather have died
than told a lie, or even allowed any person to believe what
was not true, therefore she answered in a low, frightened
<a name="p0040.png" id="p0040.png" href="#p0040.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>voice, while the tears came into her eyes, &ldquo;My hair has
not been burned off, grandmama! but&mdash;<span class="nw">but&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, child! speak out!&rdquo; said Lady Harriet, impatiently,
&ldquo;did some hair-dresser come to the house and rob you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or are you like the ladies of Carthage who gave their
long hair for bows and arrows?&rdquo; asked Major Graham.
&ldquo;I never saw such a little fright in my life as you look
now; but tell us all about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been quite as naughty as Harry!&rdquo; answered
Laura, bursting into tears and sobbing with grief; &ldquo;I was
cutting off my hair with Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s scissors all the
time that he was setting the nursery on fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did any mortal ever hear of two such little torments!&rdquo;
exclaimed Major Graham, hardly able to help laughing. &ldquo;I
wonder if anybody else in the world has such mischievous
children!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is certainly very strange, that you and Harry never
can contrive to be three hours out of a scrape!&rdquo; said Lady
Harriet gravely; &ldquo;now Frank, on the contrary, never forgets
what I bid him do. You might suppose he carried
Mrs. Crabtree in his pocket, to remind him constantly of
his duty; but there are not two such boys in the world as
Frank!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; added Major Graham; &ldquo;Harry set the house on
fire, and Frank will set the Thames on fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Laura saw uncle David put on one of his funny
looks, while he spoke in this way to Lady Harriet, she almost
forgot her former fright, and became surprised to
observe her grandmama busy preparing what she called a
coach-wheel, which had been often given as a treat to Harry
and herself when they were particularly good. This delightful
wheel was manufactured by taking a whole round
slice of the loaf, in the centre of which was placed a large
tea-spoonful of jelly, after which long spokes of marmalade,
jam, and honey, were made to diverge most tastefully in
<a name="p0041.png" id="p0041.png" href="#p0041.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>every direction towards the crust, and Laura watched the
progress of this business with great interest and anxiety,
wondering if it could be hoped that her grandmama really
meant to forgive all her misconduct during the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That coach-wheel is, of course, meant for me!&rdquo; said
Major Graham, pretending to be very hungry, and looking
slyly at Laura; &ldquo;It cannot possibly be intended for our
little hair-dresser here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is!&rdquo; answered Lady Harriet, smiling. &ldquo;I
have some thoughts of excusing Laura this time, because
she always tells me the truth, without attempting to conceal
any foolish thing she does. It will be very long before she
has any hair to cut off again, so I hope she may be older
and wiser by that time, especially considering that every
looking-glass she sees for six months will make her feel
ashamed of herself. She certainly deserves some reward
for having prevented the house to-night from being burned
to the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you think so, because here is a shilling that
has been burning in my pocket for the last few minutes, as
I wished to bestow it on Laura for having saved all our
lives, and if she had behaved still better, I might perhaps
have given her a gold watch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura was busily employed in eating her coach-wheel,
and trying to fancy what the gold watch would have looked
like which she might probably have got from uncle David,
when suddenly the door burst open, and Mrs. Crabtree hurried
into the room, with a look of surprise and alarm, her
face as red as a poppy, and her eye fixed on the hole in her
best gown, while she spoke so loud and angrily, that Laura
almost trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, my lady! where can Master Harry be?
I cannot find him in any corner!&mdash;we have been searching
all over the house, up stairs and down stairs, in vain. Not
<a name="p0042.png" id="p0042.png" href="#p0042.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>a garret or a closet but has been ransacked, and nobody can
guess what has become of him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you look up the chimney, Mrs. Crabtree?&rdquo; asked
Major Graham, laughing to see how excited she looked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Sir! it is no joke,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Crabtree,
sulkily; &ldquo;I am almost afraid Master Harry has been burned
in the fire! The last time Betty saw him, he was throwing
a jug of water into the flames, and no one has ever seen
or heard of him since! There is a great many ashes and
cinders lying about the room, <span class="nw">and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span><!-- original lacks endquote --></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think, in sober seriousness, Mrs. Crabtree, that
Harry would melt away like a wax doll, without asking any
body to extinguish him?&rdquo; said Major Graham, smiling.
&ldquo;No! no! little boys are not quite so easily disposed of.
I shall find Harry in less than five minutes, if he is above
ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But uncle David was quite mistaken in expecting to discover
Harry so easily, for he searched and searched in vain.
He looked into every possible or impossible place&mdash;the library,
the kitchen, the garrets, the laundry, the drawing-room,
all without success,&mdash;he peeped under the tables, behind
the curtains, over the beds, beneath the pillows, and
into Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s bonnet-box,&mdash;he even opened the tea-chest,
and looked out at the window, in case Harry had
tumbled over, but nowhere could he be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a mouse is stirring!&rdquo; exclaimed Major Graham,
beginning now to look exceedingly grave and anxious.
&ldquo;This is very strange! The house-door is locked, therefore,
unless Harry made his escape through the key-hole,
he must be here! It is most unaccountable what the little
pickle can have done with himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Major Graham chose to exert his voice, it was as
loud as a trumpet, and could be heard half a mile off; so he
now called out, like thunder, from the top of the stairs to the
<a name="p0043.png" id="p0043.png" href="#p0043.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">43</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>bottom, saying, &ldquo;Hollo, Harry! hollo! Come here, my
boy! Nobody shall hurt you! Harry! where are you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle David waited to listen, but all was still,&mdash;no answer
could be heard, and there was not a sound in the
house, except poor Laura at the bottom of the stairs, sobbing
with grief and terror about Harry having been lost, and
Mrs. Crabtree grumbling angrily to herself, on account of
the large hole in her best gown.</p>

<p>By this time Lady Harriet nearly fainted with fatigue,
for she was so very old, and had been ill all day; so she
grew worse and worse, till everybody said she must go to
bed, and try if it would be possible to fall asleep, assuring
her that Harry must soon be found, as nothing particular
could have happened to him, or some person would have
seen it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my lady! Master Harry is just like a bad shilling
that is sure to come back,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crabtree, helping
her to undress, while she continued to talk the whole
time about the fire, showing her own unfortunate gown, describing
the trouble she had taken to save the house from
being burned, and always ending every sentence with a
wish that she could lay her hands on Harry to punish him as
he deserved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is, I just spoil and indulge the children too
much, my lady!&rdquo; added Mrs. Crabtree, in a self-satisfied
tone of voice. &ldquo;I really blame myself often for being
over easy and kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have nothing to accuse yourself of in that respect,&rdquo;
answered Lady Harriet, unable to help smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship is very good to say so. Major Graham
is so fond of our young people, that it is lucky they have
some one to keep them in order. I shall make a duty, my
lady, of being more strict than ever. Master Harry must
be made an example of this time!&rdquo; added Mrs. Crabtree,
angrily glancing at the hole in her gown. &ldquo;I shall teach
<a name="p0044.png" id="p0044.png" href="#p0044.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>him to remember this day the longest hour he has to
live!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry will not forget it any how,&rdquo; answered Lady
Harriet languidly. &ldquo;Perhaps, Mrs. Crabtree, we might as
well not be severe with the poor boy on this occasion. As
the old proverb says, &lsquo;there is no use in pouring water on
a drowned mouse.&rsquo; Harry has got a sad fright for his
pains, and at all events you must find him first, before he
can be punished. Where can the poor child be hid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would give sixpence to find out that, my lady!&rdquo; answered
Mrs. Crabtree, helping Lady Harriet into bed, after
which she closed the shutters, put out the candles, and
left the room, angrily muttering, &ldquo;Master Harry cares no
more for me than the poker cares for the tongs, but I
shall teach him another story soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Harriet now feebly closed her eyes, being quite exhausted,
and was beginning to feel the pleasant, confused
sensation that people have before going to sleep, when
some noise made her suddenly start quite awake. She sat
up in bed to listen, but could not be sure whether it had
been a great noise at a distance, or a little noise in the
room; so after waiting two or three minutes, she sunk
back upon the pillows, and tried to forget it. Again, however,
she distinctly heard something rustling in the bed
curtains, and opened her eyes to see what could be the matter,
but all was dark. Something seemed to be breathing
very near her, however, and the curtains shook worse than
before, till Lady Harriet became really alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must surely be a cat in the room!&rdquo; thought she,
hastily pulling the bell rope, till it nearly came down.
&ldquo;That tiresome little animal will make such a noise, I
shall not be able to sleep all night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next minute Lady Harriet was startled to hear a
loud sob close beside her; and when everybody rushed up
stairs to ask what was the matter, they brought candles to
<a name="p0045.png" id="p0045.png" href="#p0045.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">45</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>search the room, and there was Harry! He lay doubled up
in a corner, and crying as if his heart would break, yet still
endeavouring not to be seen; for Harry always thought it a terrible
disgrace to cry, and would have concealed himself anywhere,
rather than be observed weeping. Laura burst into
tears also, when she saw what red eyes and pale cheeks
Harry had; but Mrs. Crabtree lost no time in pulling him
out of his place, being quite impatient to begin her scold, and
to produce her tawse, though she received a sad disappointment
on this occasion, as uncle David unexpectedly interfered
to get him off.</p>

<p class="nobot">&ldquo;Come now, Mrs. Crabtree,&rdquo; said he good-naturedly;
&ldquo;put up the tawse for this time; you are rather too fond of
the leather. Harry seems really sorry and frightened, so we
must be merciful. That cataract of tears he is shedding
now, would have extinguished the fire if it had come in
time! Harry is like a culprit with the rope about his neck;
but he shall not be executed. Let me be judge and jury in
this case; and my sentence is a very dreadful one. Harry
must sleep all to-night in the burned nursery, having no
other covering than the burned blankets, with large holes
in them, that he may never forget</p>

<div>And speaks in all their looks, and all their ways.</div>
</div>
<p class="rt sc">Crabbe.</p>
</div>



<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">Next</span> day after the fire, Laura could think of nothing but
what she was to do with the shilling that uncle David had
given her; and a thousand plans came into her head, while
many wants entered her thoughts, which never occurred before;
so that, if twenty shillings had been in her hand instead
of one, they would all have gone twenty different ways.</p>

<p>Lady Harriet advised that it should be laid bye till Laura
had fully considered what she would like best; reminding
her very truly, that money is lame in coming, but flies in going
away. &ldquo;Many people can get a shilling, Laura,&rdquo; said
her grandmama; &ldquo;but the difficulty is to keep it; for you
know the old proverb tells that &lsquo;a fool and his money are
soon parted.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss! so give it to me, and I shall take care of
your shilling!&rdquo; added Mrs. Crabtree, holding out her hand
to Laura, who fell that if her money once disappeared into
that capacious pocket, she would never see it again. &ldquo;Children
have no use for money! that shilling will only burn a
hole in your purse, till it is spent on some foolish thing or
<a name="p0047.png" id="p0047.png" href="#p0047.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">47</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>other. You will be losing your thimble soon, or mislaying
your gloves; for all these things seem to fly in every direction,
as if they got legs and wings as soon as they belong
to you; so then that shilling may replace what is lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crabtree looked as if she would eat it up; but Laura
grasped her treasure still tighter in her hand, exclaiming,</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no! this is mine! Uncle David never thought
of my shilling being taken care of! He meant me to do
whatever I liked with it! Uncle David says he cannot endure
saving children, and that he wishes all money were
turned into slates, when little girls keep it longer than a
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that!&rdquo; said Harry, eagerly; &ldquo;it is so pleasant
to spend money, when the shopkeeper bows to me over the
counter so politely, and asks what I please to want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Older people than you like spending money, Master
Harry, and spend whether they have it or no; but the greatest
pleasure is to keep it. For instance, Miss Laura, whatever
she sees worth a shilling in any shop, might be hers
if she pleases; so then it is quite as good as her own.
We shall look in at the bazaar every morning, to fix upon
something that she would like to have, and then consider of
it for two or three days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura thought this plan so very unsatisfactory, that she
lost no time in getting her shilling changed into two sixpences,
one of which she immediately presented to Harry,
who positively refused for a long time to accept of it, insisting
that Laura should rather buy some pretty plaything for
herself; but she answered that it was much pleasanter to divide
her fortune with Harry, than to be selfish, and spend it
all alone. &ldquo;I am sure, Harry,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;if this money
had been yours, you would have said the same thing, and
given the half of what you got to me; so now let us say no
more about that, but tell me what would be the best use to
make of my sixpence?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0048.png" id="p0048.png" href="#p0048.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">48</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;You might buy that fine red morocco purse we saw in
the shop window yesterday,&rdquo; observed Harry, looking very
serious and anxious, on being consulted. &ldquo;Do you remember
how much we both wished to have it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is the use of a purse, with no money to keep
in it!&rdquo; answered Laura, looking earnestly at Harry for more
advice. &ldquo;Think again of something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like a new doll?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I have nothing to dress her with!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you buy that pretty geranium in a red flower-pot
at the gardener&#8217;s!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it would only live for a week, I might be tempted to
try; but flowers will always die with me. They seem to
wither when I so much as look at them. Do you remember
that pretty fuchsia<!-- original reads "fuschia" --> that I almost drowned the first day grandmama
gave it me; and we forgot for a week afterwards to
water it at all. I am not a good flower doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then buy a gold watch at once,&rdquo; said Harry, laughing;
&ldquo;or a fine pony, with a saddle, to ride on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Harry, pray be quite in earnest. You know I
might as well attempt to buy the moon as a gold watch; so
think of something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very difficult to make a good use of money,&rdquo; said
Harry, pretending to look exceedingly wise. &ldquo;Do you
know, Laura, I once found out that you could have twelve
of those large ship biscuits we saw at the baker&#8217;s shop for
sixpence. Only think! you could feed the whole town, and
make a present to everybody in the house besides! I dare
say Mrs. Crabtree might like one with her tea. All the
maids would think them a treat. You could present one to
Frank, another to old Andrew, and there would still be some
left for these poor children at the cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that is the very thing!&rdquo; cried Laura, running out
of the room to send Andrew off with a basket, and looking
as happy as possible. Not long afterwards, Frank, who
<a name="p0049.png" id="p0049.png" href="#p0049.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>had returned from school, was standing at the nursery window,
when he suddenly called out in a voice of surprise and
amazement,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Harry! look at old Andrew! he is carrying
something tied up in a towel, as large as his own head!
what can it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all for me! these are my biscuits!&rdquo; said Laura,
running off to receive the parcel, and though she heard
Frank laughing, while Harry told all about them, she did not
care, but brought her whole collection triumphantly into the
nursery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh fancy! how perfect!&rdquo; cried Harry, opening the
bundle; &ldquo;this is very good fun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are provisions for a siege!&rdquo; added Frank. &ldquo;You
have at least got enough for your money, Laura!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take one yourself, Frank!&rdquo; said she, reaching him
the largest, and then, with the rest all tied in her apron,
Laura proceeded up and down stairs, making presents to
every person she met, till her whole store was finished; and
she felt quite satisfied and happy because everybody seemed
pleased and returned many thanks, except Mrs. Crabtree,
who said she had no teeth to eat such hard things, which
were only fit for sailors going to America or the West
Indies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have bought me a pound of sugar, Miss
Laura, and that might have been a present worth giving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too sweet already, Mrs. Crabtree!&rdquo; said Frank,
laughing. &ldquo;I shall send you a sugar-cane from the West
Indies, to beat Harry and Laura with, and a whole barrel of
sugar for yourself, from my own estate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your nonsense, Master Frank! Get out of the
nursery this moment! You with an estate indeed! You will
not have a place to put your foot upon soon except the topmast
in a man-of-war, where all the bad boys in a ship are
sent.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0050.png" id="p0050.png" href="#p0050.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">50</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Perhaps, as you are not to be the captain, I may escape,
and be dining with the officers sometimes! I mean to send
you home a fine new India shawl, Mrs. Crabtree, the very
moment I arrive at Madras, and some china tea-cups from
Canton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks and nonsense!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crabtree, who
sometimes enjoyed a little jesting with Frank. &ldquo;Keep all
them rattle-traps till you are a rich nabob, and come home
to look for Mrs. Frank,&mdash;a fine wife she will be! Ladies
that get fortunes from India are covered all over with gold
chains, and gold muslins, and scarlet shawls. She will eat
nothing but curry and rice, and never put her foot to the
ground except to step into her carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not a gipsey, to tell fortunes!&rdquo; cried
Harry, laughing; &ldquo;Frank would die rather than take such
a wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or, at least, I would rather have a tooth drawn than do
it,&rdquo; added Frank, smiling. &ldquo;Perhaps I may prefer to marry
one of those old wives on the chimney-tops; but it is too
serious to say I would rather die, because nobody knows
how awful it is to die, till the appointed day comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true and proper, Master Frank,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Crabtree; &ldquo;you speak like a printed book sometimes, and
you deserve a good wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall return home some day with chests of gold,
and let you choose one for me, as quiet and good-natured as
yourself, Mrs. Crabtree,&rdquo; said Frank, taking up his books
and hastening off to school, running all the way, as he was
rather late, and Mr. Lexicon, the master, had promised a
grand prize for the boy who came most punctually to his
lessons, which everybody declared that Frank was sure to
gain, as he had never once been absent at the right moment.<!-- original has superfluous endquote --></p>

<p>Major Graham often tried to teaze Frank, by calling him
&ldquo;the Professor,&rdquo;&mdash;asking him questions which it was
<a name="p0051.png" id="p0051.png" href="#p0051.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>impossible to answer, and then pretending to be quite shocked
at his ignorance; but no one ever saw the young scholar
put out of temper by those tricks and trials, for he always
laughed more heartily than any one else, at the joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now show me, Frank,&rdquo; said uncle David, one morning,
&ldquo;how do you advance three steps backwards?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is quite impossible, unless you turn me into a
crab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then, which is the principal town in Caffraria?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any town there? I do not recollect it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then so much the worse!&mdash;how are you ever to get
through life without knowing the chief town in Caffraria!
I am quite ashamed of your ignorance. Now let us try a
little arithmetic! Open the door of your understanding and
tell me, when wheat is six shillings a bushel, what is the
price of a penny loaf. Take your slate and calculate that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, uncle David, if you will find out, when gooseberries
are two shillings the pint, what is the price of a threepenny
tart. You remind me of my old nursery <span class="nw">song&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="top1">Some days after Laura had distributed the biscuits, she
became very sorry for having squandered her shilling, without
attending to Lady Harriet&#8217;s good advice, about keeping
it carefully in her pocket for at least a week, to see what
would happen. A very pleasant way of using money now
fell in her way, but she had been a foolish spendthrift, so
her pockets were empty, when she most wished them to be
full. Harry came that morning after breakfast into the nursery,
looking in a great bustle, and whispering to Laura,
&ldquo;What a pity your sixpence is gone! but as Mrs. Crabtree
says, &lsquo;we cannot both eat our cake and have it!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

 /></span></a>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered Laura, as seriously as if she had never
thought of this before, &ldquo;but why do you so particularly wish
my money back to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because such a very nice, funny thing is to be done
this morning. You and I are asked to join the party, but
I am afraid we cannot afford it! All our little cousins and
companions intend going with Mr. Harwood, the tutor, at
twelve o&#8217;clock, to climb up to the very top of Arthur&#8217;s Seat,
where they are to dine and have a dance. There will be
about twenty boys and girls of the party, but every body is to
carry a basket filled with provisions for dinner, either
cakes, or fruit, or biscuits, which are to be eat on the great
rock at the top of the hill. Now grandmama says we
ought to have had money enough to supply what is necessary,
and then we might have gone, but no one can be admitted
who has not at least sixpence to buy something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how provoking!&rdquo; said Laura, sadly, &ldquo;I wonder
when we shall learn always to follow grandmama&#8217;s advice,
for that is sure to turn out best in the end. I never take
my own way without being sorry for it afterwards, so I deserve
now to be disappointed and remain at home; but,
Harry, your sixpence is still safe, so pray join this delightful
party, and tell me all about it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it could take us both, I should be very happy, but I
will not go without you, Laura, after you were so good to
me, and gave me this in a present. No, no! I only wish
we could do like the poor madman grandmama mentioned,
who planted sixpences in the ground that they might grow
into shillings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray! what are you two looking so solemn about?&rdquo; asked
Frank, hurrying into the room, at that moment, on his way
to school. &ldquo;Are you talking of some mischief that has
been done already, or only about some mischief you are
intending to do soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither the one nor the other,&rdquo; answered Laura.
<a name="p0053.png" id="p0053.png" href="#p0053.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>&ldquo;But, oh! Frank, I am sure you will be sorry for us, when
we tell you of our sad disappointment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She then related the whole story of the party to Arthur&#8217;s
Seat, mentioning that Mr. Harwood had kindly offered to
take charge of Harry and herself, but as her little fortune
had been so foolishly squandered, she could not go, and
Harry said it would be impossible to enjoy the fun without
her, though Lady Harriet had given them both leave to be
of the party.</p>

<p>All the time that Laura spoke, Frank stood, with his
hands in his pockets, where he seemed evidently searching
for something, and when the whole history was told, he
said to Harry, &ldquo;Let me see this poor little sixpence of
yours! I am a very clever conjuror, and could perhaps
turn it into a shilling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Frank!&rdquo; said Laura, laughing; &ldquo;you
might as well turn Harry into uncle David!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! we shall see!&rdquo; answered Frank, taking up the
sixpence. &ldquo;I have put the money into this box!&mdash;rattle it
well!&mdash;once! twice! thrice!&mdash;there, peep in!&mdash;now it is a
shilling! I told you so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank ran joyously out of the room, being much amused
with the joke, for he had put one of his own shillings into
the box for Harry and Laura, who were excessively surprised
at first, and felt really ashamed to take this very kind
present from Frank, when he so seldom had money of his
own; but they knew how generous he was, for he often repeated
that excellent maxim, &ldquo;It is more blessed to give
than to receive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a few minutes, they remembered that nothing
could prevent them now from going with Mr. Harwood to
Arthur&#8217;s Seat, which put Laura into such a state of ecstacy,
that she danced round the room for joy, while Harry jumped
upon the tables and chairs, tumbled head over heels, and
called Betty to come immediately that they might get ready.</p>

<p><a name="p0054.png" id="p0054.png" href="#p0054.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">54</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>When Mrs. Crabtree heard such an uproar, she hastened
also into the room, asking what had happened to cause this
riot, and she became very angry indeed, to hear that Harry
and Laura had both got leave to join in this grand expedition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be spoiling all your clothes, and getting yourselves
into a heat! I wonder her ladyship allows this!
How much better you would be taking a quiet walk with me
in the gardens! I shall really speak to Lady Harriet about
it! The air must be very cold on the top of them great
mountains! I am sure you will both have colds for a
month after this Tom-foolery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Mrs. Crabtree! I promise not to catch cold!&rdquo;
cried Harry, eagerly; &ldquo;and, besides, you can scarcely prevent
our going now, for grandmama has set out on her
long airing in the carriage, so there is nobody for you to
ask about keeping us at home, except uncle David!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crabtree knew from experience, that Major Graham
was a hopeless case, as he always took part with the
children, and liked nothing so much for old and young as
&ldquo;a ploy;&rdquo; so she grumbled on to herself, while her eyes
looked as sharp as a pair of scissors with rage. &ldquo;You will
come back, turned into scare-crows, with all your nice
clean clothes in tatters,&rdquo; said she, angrily; &ldquo;but if there is
so much as a speck upon this best new jacket and trowsers,
I shall know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a comfort it would be, if there were no such
things in the world as &lsquo;new clothes,&rsquo; for I am always so
much happier in the old ones,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;People at
the shops should sell clothes that will never either dirty or
tear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be dressed in fur, like Robinson Crusoe,
or sent out naked, like the little savages,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crabtree,
&ldquo;or painted black and blue like them wild old Britons
that lived here long ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0055.png" id="p0055.png" href="#p0055.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">55</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;I am black and blue sometimes, without being painted,&rdquo;
said Harry, escaping to the door. &ldquo;Good-bye, Mrs.
Crabtree! I hope you will not die of weariness without
us! On our return we shall tell you all our delightful adventures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About half an hour afterwards, Harry and Laura were
seen hurrying out of the pastry-cook, Mrs. Weddell&#8217;s shop,
bearing little covered baskets in their hands, but nobody
could guess what was in them. They whispered and
laughed together with very merry faces, looking the very
pictures of happiness, and running along as fast as they
could to join the noisy party of their cousins and companions,
almost fearing that Mr. Harwood might have set off
without them. Frank often called him &ldquo;Mr. Punctuality,&rdquo;
as he was so very particular about his scholars being in
good time on all occasions; and certainly Mr. Harwood
carried his watch more in his hand than in his pocket,
being in the habit of constantly looking to see that nobody
arrived too late. Mail-coaches or steamboats could hardly
keep the time better, when an hour had once been named,
and the last words that Harry heard when he was invited
were, &ldquo;Remember! sharp twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great clock of St. Andrew&#8217;s Church was busy striking
that hour, and every little clock in the town was saying the
same thing, when Mr. Harwood himself, with his watch in
his hand, opened the door, and walked out, followed by a
dozen of merry-faced boys and girls, all speaking at once,
and vociferating louder than the clocks, as if they thought
everybody had grown deaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall reach the top of Arthur&#8217;s Seat first,&rdquo; said Peter
Grey. &ldquo;All of you follow me, for I know the shortest way.
It is only a hop, step, and a jump!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather a long step!&rdquo; cried Robert Fordyce. &ldquo;But I
could lead you a much better way, though I shall show it to
nobody but myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0056.png" id="p0056.png" href="#p0056.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;We must certainly drink water at St. Anthony&#8217;s Well,&rdquo;
observed Laura; &ldquo;because whatever any one wishes for
when he tastes it, is sure to happen immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall wish that some person may give me a new
doll,&rdquo; said Mary Forrester. &ldquo;My old one is only fit for
being lady&#8217;s maid to a fine new doll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in ninety-nine minds what to wish for,&rdquo; exclaimed
Harry; &ldquo;we must take care not to be like the foolish
old woman in the fairy tale, who got only a yard of black
pudding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall ask for a piebald pony, with a whip, a saddle, and
a bridle!&rdquo; cried Peter Grey; &ldquo;and for a week&#8217;s holidays,&mdash;and
a new watch,&mdash;and a spade,&mdash;and a box of French plums,&mdash;and
to be first at the top of Arthur&#8217;s Seat,&mdash;and&mdash;<span class="nw">and&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, Peter!&mdash;stop! you can only have one wish at St.
Anthony&#8217;s Well,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Harwood. &ldquo;If you ask
more, you lose all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very hard, for I want everything,&rdquo; replied Peter.
&ldquo;What are you wishing for, Sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I ask for?&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood, reflecting
to himself. &ldquo;I have not a want in the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes, Sir! you must wish for something!&rdquo; cried the
whole party, eagerly. &ldquo;Do invent something to ask, Mr.
Harwood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I wish you may all behave well till we reach the
top of Arthur&#8217;s Seat, and all come safely down again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be sure of that already!&rdquo; said Peter, laughing.
&ldquo;I set such a very good example to all my companions,
that they never behave ill when I am present,&mdash;no! not
even by accident! When Dr. Algebra examined our class
to-day, he asked Mr. Lexicon, &lsquo;What has become of the
best boy in your school this morning?&rsquo; and the answer
was, &lsquo;Of course your mean Peter Grey! He is gone to the
top of Arthur&#8217;s Seat with that excellent man, Mr. Harwood!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0057.png" id="p0057.png" href="#p0057.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Indeed!&mdash;and pray, Master Peter, what bird whispered
this story into your ear, seeing it has all happened since we
left home!&mdash;but people who are praised by nobody else, often
take to praising themselves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows better!&mdash;and here is Harry Graham, the
very ditto of myself,&mdash;so steady he might be fit to drill a
whole regiment. We shall lead the party quite safely up the
hill, and down again, without any ladders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And without wings,&rdquo; added Harry, laughing; &ldquo;but what
are we to draw water out of the well with?&mdash;here are neither
buckets, nor tumblers, nor glasses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could lend you my thimble!&rdquo; said Laura, searching
her pocket. &ldquo;That will hold enough of water for one wish,
and every person may have the loan of it in turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the very first time your thimble has been of use
to anybody!&rdquo; said Harry, slyly; &ldquo;but I dare say it is not
worn into holes with too much sewing, therefore it will make
a famous little magical cup for St. Anthony&#8217;s Well. You
know the fairies who dance here by moonlight, lay their table-cloth
upon a mushroom, and sit round it, to be merry,
but I never heard what they use for a drinking cup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry now proceeded briskly along to the well, singing
as he went, a song which had been taught him by uncle
David, beginning,</p>

<div class="poem w20 pl6">
<div class="stanza notopspace">
<div>I wish I were a brewer&#8217;s horse,</div>
<div>Five quarters of a year,</div>
<div>I&#8217;d place my head where was my tail,</div>
<div>And drink up all the beer.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent top1">Before long the whole party seated themselves in a circle
on the grass round St. Anthony&#8217;s Well, while any stranger
who had chanced to pass might have supposed, from the
noise and merriment, that the Saint had filled his well with
champagne<!-- original reads "champaigne" --> and punch for the occasion, as everybody seemed
perfectly tipsy with happiness. Mr. Harwood laughed
<a name="p0058.png" id="p0058.png" href="#p0058.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>prodigiously at some of the jokes, and made a few of his own,
which were none of the best, though they caused the most
laughter, for the boys thought it very surprising that so grave
and great a man should make a joke at all.</p>

<p>When Mary Forrester drank her thimbleful of water, and
wished for a new doll, Peter and Harry privately cut out a
face upon a red-cheeked apple, making the eyes, nose, and
mouth, after which, they hastily dressed it up in pocket handkerchiefs,
and gave her this present from the fairies, which
looked so very like what she had asked for, that the laugh
which followed was loud and long. Afterwards Peter swallowed
his draught, calling loudly for a piebald pony, when
Harry in his white trowsers, and dark jacket, went upon all-fours,
and let Peter mount on his back. It was very difficult,
however, to get Peter off again, for he enjoyed the fun
excessively, and stuck to his seat like Sinbad&#8217;s old man of
the sea, till at last Harry rolled round on his back, tumbling
Peter head over heels into St. Anthony&#8217;s Well, upon seeing
which, Mr. Harwood rose, saying, he had certainly lost his
own wish, as they had behaved ill, and met with an accident
already. Harry laughingly proposed that Peter should be
carefully hung upon a tree to dry, till they all came down
again; but the mischievous boy ran off so fast, he was almost
out of sight in a moment, saying, &ldquo;Now for the top
of Arthur&#8217;s Seat, and I shall grow dry with the fatigue of
climbing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys and girls immediately scattered themselves all
over the hill, getting on the best way they could, and trying
who could scramble up fastest, but the grass was quite short,
and as slippery as ice, therefore it became every moment
more difficult to stand, and still more difficult to climb. The
whole party began sliding whether they liked it or not, and
staggered and tried to grasp the turf, but there was nothing
to hold, while occasionally a shower of stones and gravel
came down from Peter, who pretended they fell by accident.</p>

<p><a name="p0059.png" id="p0059.png" href="#p0059.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Oh, Harry!&rdquo; cried Laura, panting for breath, while she
looked both frightened and fatigued, &ldquo;If this were not a party
of pleasure, I think we are sometimes quite as happy in
our own gardens! People must be very miserable at home,
before they come here to be amused! I wish we were cats,
or goats, or any thing that can stand upon a hill without feeling
giddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think this is very good fun!&rdquo; answered Harry, <!-- original has extraneous opening quote -->gasping
and trying not to tumble for the twentieth time; &ldquo;you
would like perhaps to be back in the nursery with Mrs.
Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no! I am not quite so bad as that! But Harry!
do you ever really expect to reach the top? for I never shall;
so I mean to sit down quietly here, and wait till you all
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a better plan than that, Laura! you shall sit upon
the highest point of Arthur&#8217;s Seat as well as anybody, before
either of us is an hour older! Let me go first, because I get
on famously, and you must never look behind, but keep
tight hold of my jacket, so then every step I advance will
pull you up also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura was delighted with this plan, which succeeded perfectly
well, but they ascended rather slowly, as it was exceedingly
fatiguing to Harry, who looked<!-- original reads "look" --> quite happy all the time
to be of use, for he always felt glad when he could do any
thing for anybody, more particularly for either Laura or
Frank. Now, the whole party was at last safely assembled
on the very highest point of Arthur&#8217;s Seat, so the boys threw
their caps up in the air, and gave three tremendous cheers,
which frightened the very crows over their heads, and sent
a flock of sheep scampering down the mountain side. After
that, they planted Mr. Harwood&#8217;s walking-stick in the
ground, for a staff, while Harry tore off the blue silk handkerchief
which Mrs. Crabtree had tied about his neck, and
without caring whether he caught cold or not, he fastened it
<a name="p0060.png" id="p0060.png" href="#p0060.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>on the pole for a flag, being quite delighted to see how it
waved in the wind most triumphantly, looking very like what
sailors put up when they take possession of a desert island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, for business!&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood, sitting down
on the rock, and uncovering a prodigious cake, nearly as
large as a cheese, which he had taken the trouble to carry,
with great difficulty, up the hill. &ldquo;I suppose nobody is
hungry after our long walk! Let us see what all the baskets
contain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a moment was lost in seating themselves on the
grass, while the stores were displayed, amidst shouts of laughter
and applause which generally followed whatever came
forth. Sandwiches, or, as Peter Grey called them, &ldquo;savages;&rdquo;
gingerbread, cakes, and fruit, all appeared in turn.
Robert Fordyce brought a dozen of hard-boiled eggs, all
dyed different colours, blue, green, pink, and yellow, but
not one was white. Edmund Ashford produced a collection
of very sour-looking apples, and Charles Forrester showed
a number of little gooseberry tarts, but when it became time
for Peter&#8217;s basket to be opened, it contained nothing except
a knife and fork to cut up whatever his companions would
give him!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter! Peter! you shabby fellow!&rdquo; said Charles Forrester,
reaching him one of his tarts, &ldquo;you should be put
in the tread-mill as a sturdy beggar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or thrown down from the top of this precipice,&rdquo; added
Harry, giving him a cake. &ldquo;I wonder you can look any of
us in the face, Peter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood, &ldquo;that a stone is
shown in Ireland, called &lsquo;the stone of Blarney,&rsquo; and whoever
kisses it, is never afterwards ashamed of any thing he
does. Our friend Peter has probably passed that way lately!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, I am not likely to be starved to death
amongst you all!&rdquo; answered the impudent boy, demolishing
<a name="p0061.png" id="p0061.png" href="#p0061.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>every thing he could get; and it is believed that Peter ate,
on this memorable occasion, three times more than any
other person, as each of the party offered him something,
and he never was heard to say, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could swallow Arthur&#8217;s Seat if it were turned into a
plum-pudding,&rdquo; said he, pocketing buns, apples, eggs, walnuts,
biscuits, and almonds, till his coat stuck out all
round like a balloon. &ldquo;Has any one any thing more to
spare?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear,&rdquo; said Mr. Harwood, &ldquo;that a pigeon
eats its own weight of food every day? Now, I am sure,
you and I know one boy in the world, Peter, who could
do as much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to be done with that prodigious cake you
carried up here, Mr. Harwood?&rdquo; answered Peter, casting
a devouring eye upon it; &ldquo;the crust seems as
hard as a rhinoceros&#8217; skin, but I dare say it is very good.
One could not be sure though, without tasting it! I hope
you are not going to take the trouble of carrying that heavy
load back again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very polite you are become all on a sudden, Peter!&rdquo;
said Laura, laughing. &ldquo;I should be very sorry to attempt
carrying that cake to the bottom of the hill, for we would
both roll down, the shortest way, together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not over-anxious to try it either,&rdquo; observed Charles
Forrester, shaking his head. &ldquo;Even Peter, though his
mouth is constantly ajar, would find that cake rather heavy
to carry, either as an inside or an outside passenger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely lift it at all!&rdquo; continued Laura, when
Mr. Harwood had again tied it up in the towel; &ldquo;what can
be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the very best plan!&rdquo; cried Harry, suddenly
seizing the prodigious cake; and before any body could
hinder him, he gave it a tremendous push off the steepest
part of Arthur&#8217;s Seat, so that it rolled down like a wheel,
<a name="p0062.png" id="p0062.png" href="#p0062.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>over stones and precipices, jumping and hopping along
with wonderful rapidity, amidst the cheers and laughter of all
the children, till at last it reached the bottom of the hill,
when a general clapping of hands ensued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a race!&rdquo; cried Harry, becoming more and
more eager. &ldquo;The first boy or girl who reaches that cake
shall have it all to himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Harwood tried with all his might to stop the commotion,
and called out that they must go quietly down the bank,
for Harry had no right to give away the cake, or to make
them break their legs and arms with racing down such a
hill: but he might as well have spoken to an east wind,
and asked it not to blow. The whole party dispersed, like
a hive of bees that has been upset; and in a moment they
were in full career after the cake.</p>

<p>Some of the boys tried to roll down, hoping to get on
more quickly. Others endeavoured to slide, and several
attempted to run, but they all fell; and many of them might
have been tumblers at Sadler&#8217;s Wells, they tumbled over
and over so cleverly. Peter Grey&#8217;s hat was blown away,
but he did not stop to catch it. Charlie Hume lost his shoe,
Robert Fordyce sprained his ancle<!-- OED legitimate spelling -->, and every one of the
girls tore her frock. It was a frightful scene; such devastation
of bonnets and jackets as had never been known before;
while Mr. Harwood looked like the General of a defeated
army, calling till he became hoarse, and running till
he was out of breath, vainly trying thus to stop the confusion,
and to bring the stragglers back in better order.</p>

<p>Meantime, Harry and Peter were far before the rest,
though Edward Ashford was following hard after them in desperate
haste, as if he still hoped to overtake their steps. Suddenly,
however, a loud cry of distress was heard over-head;
and when Harry looked up, he saw so very alarming a sight,
that he could scarcely believe his eyes, and almost screamed
out himself with the fright it gave him, while he seemed to
<a name="p0063.png" id="p0063.png" href="#p0063.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>forget in a moment, the race, Peter Grey, and the prodigious
cake.</p>

<p>Laura had been very anxious not to trouble Harry with
taking care of her in coming down the bank again; for she
saw that during all this fun about the cake, he perfectly forgot
that she was not accustomed every day to such a scramble
on the hills, and would have required some help. After
looking down every side of the descent, and thinking that
each appeared steeper than another, while they all made her
equally giddy, Laura determined to venture on a part of the
hill which seemed rather less precipitous than the rest; but it
completely cheated her, being the most difficult and dangerous
part of Arthur&#8217;s Seat. The slope became steeper and
steeper at every step; but Laura always tried to hope her
path might grow better, till at last she reached a place where
it was impossible to stop herself. Down she went, down!
down! whether she would or not, screaming and sliding on
a long slippery bank, till she reached the very edge of a dangerous
precipice, which appeared higher than the side of
a room. Laura then grappled hold of some stones and
grass, calling loudly for help, while scarcely able to keep
from falling into the deep ravine, which would probably have
killed her. Her screams were echoed all over the hill, when
Harry seeing her frightful situation, clambered up the bank
faster than any lamplighter, and immediately flew to Laura&#8217;s
assistance, who was now really hanging over the chasm,
quite unable to help herself. At last he reached the place
where poor Laura lay, and seized hold of her by the frock;
but for some time it seemed an equal chance whether she
dragged him into the hole, or he pulled her away from it.
Luckily, however, by a great effort, Harry succeeded in delivering
Laura, whom he placed upon a secure situation, and
then, having waited patiently till she recovered from the
fright, he led her carefully and kindly down to the bottom
of Arthur&#8217;s Seat.</p>

<p><a name="p0064.png" id="p0064.png" href="#p0064.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>Now, all the boys had already got there, and a violent dispute
was going on about which of them first reached the
cake. Peter Grey had pushed down Edward Ashford, who
caught hold of Robert Fordyce, and they all three rolled to
the bottom together, so that nobody could tell which had won
the race; while Mr. Harwood laboured in vain to convince
them that the cake belonged neither to the one nor the other,
being his own property.</p>

<p>They all laughed at Harry for being distanced, and arriving
last; while Mr. Harwood watched him coming down, and
was pleased to observe how carefully he attended to Laura,
though<!-- original reads "though" --> still, being annoyed at the riot and confusion which
Harry had occasioned, he determined to appear exceedingly
angry, and put on a very terrible voice, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hollo! young gentleman! what shall I do to you for
beginning this uproar? As the old proverb says, &lsquo;one fool
makes many.&rsquo; How dare you roll my fine cake down the
hill in this way, and send everybody rolling after it? Look
me in the face, and say you are ashamed of yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry looked at Mr. Harwood&mdash;and Mr. Harwood looked
at Harry. They both tried to seem very grave and serious,
but somehow Harry&#8217;s eyes glittered very brightly, and two
little dimples might be seen in his cheeks. Mr. Harwood
also had his eye-brows gathered into a terrible frown, but
still his eyes were likewise sparkling, and his mouth seemed
to be pursed up in a most comical manner. After staring
at each other for several minutes, both Mr. Harwood and
Harry burst into a prodigious fit of laughing, and nobody
could tell which began first or laughed longest.</p>

<p class="nobot">&ldquo;Master Graham! you must send a new frock to every
little girl of the party, and a suit of clothes to each of the
boys, for having caused theirs to be all destroyed. I really
meant to punish you severely for beginning such a riot, but
something has made me change my mind. In almost every
moment of our lives, we either act amiably of unamiably,

</div>
</div>


<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">Once</span> upon a time Harry and Laura had got into so many
scrapes, that there seemed really no end to their misconduct.
They generally forgot to learn any lessons&mdash;often tore their
books&mdash;drew pictures on their slates, instead of calculating
sums&mdash;and made the pages of their copy-books into boats;
besides which, Mrs. Crabtree caught them one day, when a
party of officers dined at Lady Harriet&#8217;s, with two of the
captain&#8217;s sword-belts buckled round their waists, and cocked
hats upon their heads, while they beat the crown of a gentleman&#8217;s
hat with a walking-stick, to sound like a drum.</p>

<p>Still it seemed impossible to make uncle David feel sufficiently
angry at them, though Mrs. Crabtree did all she
could to put him in a passion, by telling the very worst;
but he made fifty excuses a-minute, as if he had been the
naughty person himself, instead of Harry or Laura, and
above all he said that they both seemed so exceedingly penitent
when he explained their delinquencies, and they were
both so ready to tell upon themselves, and to take all the
blame of whatever mischief might be done, that he was
<a name="p0067.png" id="p0067.png" href="#p0067.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">67</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>determined to shut his eyes and say nothing, unless they did
something purposely wrong.</p>

<p>One night, when Mrs. Crabtree had gone out, Major
Graham felt quite surprised on his return home from a late
dinner party, to find Laura and Harry still out of bed.
They were sitting in his library when he entered, both looking
so tired and miserable that he could not imagine what
had happened; but Harry lost no time in confessing that
he and Laura feared they had done some dreadful mischief,
so they could not sleep without asking pardon, and mentioning
whose fault it was, that the maids might not be unjustly
blamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you little imps of mischief! what have I to scold
you for now?&rdquo; asked uncle David, not looking particularly
angry. &ldquo;Is it something that I shall be obliged to take the
trouble of punishing you for? We ought to live in the Highlands,
where there are whole forests of birch ready for use?
Why are your ears like a bell-rope, Harry? because they
seem made to be pulled. Now, go on with your story.
What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were playing about the room, uncle David, and
Laura lost her ball, so she crept under that big table which
has only one large leg. There is a brass button below, so
we were trying if it would come off, when all on a sudden,
the table fell quite to one side, as you see it now, tumbling
down those prodigious books and tin boxes on the floor!
I cannot think how this fine new table could be so easily
broken; but whenever we even look at anything, it seems
to break!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Harry! You remind me of Meddlesome Matty in
the nursery rhymes,</p>

<div class="poem w18 pl4">
<div class="stanza notopspace">
<div>&ldquo;Sometimes she&#8217;d lift the teapot lid</div>
<div>To peep at what was in it,</div>
<div>Or tilt the kettle, if you did</div>
<div>But turn your back a minute.</div>
<div><a name="p0068.png" id="p0068.png" href="#p0068.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>In vain you told her not to touch,</div>
<div>Her trick of meddling grew so much.&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent top1">You have scarcely left my poor table a leg to stand upon!
How am I ever to get it mended?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the carpenter could do it to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or, perhaps uncle David could do it this moment,&rdquo; said
Major Graham, raising the fallen side with a sudden jerk,
when Harry and Laura heard a sound under the table like
the locking of a door, after which the whole affair was rectified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I <span class="nw">ever&mdash;!&rdquo;</span> exclaimed Harry, staring with astonishment,
&ldquo;so we have suffered all our fright for nothing, and
the table was not really broken! I shall always run to you,
uncle David, when we are in a scrape, for you are sure to
get us off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not reckon too certainly on that, Master Harry; it
is easier to get into one than to get out of it, any day; but
I am not so seriously angry at the sort of scrapes Laura and
you get into, because you would not willingly and deliberately
do wrong. If any children commit a mean action, or
get into a passion, or quarrel with each other, or omit saying
their prayers and reading their Bibles, or tell a lie, or
take what does not belong to them, then it might be seen
how extremely angry I could be; but while you continue
merely thoughtless and forgetful, I mean to have patience a
little longer before turning into a cross old uncle with a pair
of tawse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry sprung upon uncle David&#8217;s knee, quite delighted
to hear him speak so very kindly, and Laura was soon installed
in her usual place there also, listening to all that was
said, and laughing at his jokes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Mrs. Crabtree says,&rdquo; continued Major Graham,
&ldquo;&lsquo;we cannot put an old head on young shoulders;&rsquo; and it
would certainly look very odd if you could.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0069.png" id="p0069.png" href="#p0069.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>So uncle David took out his pencil, and drew a funny picture
of a cross old wrinkled face upon young shoulders, like
Laura&#8217;s, and after they had all laughed at it together for about
five minutes, he sent the children both to bed, quite merry
and cheerful.</p>

<p>A long time elapsed afterwards without anything going
wrong; and it was quite pleasant to see such learning of
lessons, such attention to rules, and such obedience to Mrs.
Crabtree, as went on in the nursery during several weeks.
At last, one day, when Lady Harriet and Major Graham
were preparing to set off on a journey, and to pay a short
visit at Holiday House, Laura and Harry observed a great
deal of whispering and talking in a corner of the room, but
they could not exactly discover what it was all about, till
Major Graham said very earnestly, &ldquo;I think we might surely
take Laura with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Lady Harriet, &ldquo;both the children have
been invited, and are behaving wonderfully well of late, but
Lord Rockville has such a dislike to noise, that I dare not
venture to take more than one at a time. Poor Laura has
a very severe cough, so she may be recovered by change of
air. As for Harry, he is quite well, and therefore he can
stay at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Harry thought it very hard that he was to be left at
home, merely because he felt quite well, so he immediately
wished to be very ill indeed, that he might have some chance
of going to Holiday House; but then he did not exactly
know how to set about it. At all events, Harry determined
to catch a cold like Laura&#8217;s, without delay. He would not,
for the whole world have pretended to suffer from a cough
if he really had none, because uncle David had often explained
that making any one believe an un-truth was the
same as telling a lie; but he thought there might be no
harm in really getting such a terrible cold, that nothing
could possibly cure it except change of air, and a trip to
<a name="p0070.png" id="p0070.png" href="#p0070.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Holiday House with Laura. Accordingly Harry tried to
remember every thing that Mrs. Crabtree had forbid him to
do &ldquo;for fear of catching cold.&rdquo; He sprinkled water over
his shirt collar in the morning before dressing, that it might
be damp; he ran violently up and down stairs to put himself
in a heat, after which he sat between the open window
and door till he felt perfectly chilled; and when going to bed
at night, he washed his hair in cold water without drying it.
Still, all was in vain! Harry had formerly caught cold a
hundred times when he did not want one; but now, such a
thing was not to be had for love or money. Nothing seemed
to give him the very slightest attempt at a cough; and
when the day at last arrived for Lady Harriet to begin her
journey, Harry still felt himself most provokingly well.
Not so much as a finger ached, his cheeks were as blooming
as roses, his voice as clear as a bell, and when uncle David
accidentally said to him in the morning, &ldquo;How do you
do?&rdquo; Harry was obliged, very much against his will, to
answer, &ldquo;Quite well, I thank you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime, Laura would have felt too happy if
Harry could only have gone with her; and even as it was,
being impatient for the happy day to arrive, she hurried to
bed an hour earlier than usual the night before, to make the
time of setting out appear nearer; and she could scarcely
sleep or eat for thinking of Holiday House, and planning
all that was to be done there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pleasant to see so joyous a face,&rdquo; said Major
Graham. &ldquo;I almost envy you, Laura, for being so happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I quite envy myself! but I shall write a long letter
every day to poor Harry, telling him all the news, and
all my adventures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Miss Laura! wait till you come home,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Crabtree. &ldquo;Who do you think is going to pay
postage for so many foolish letters?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0071.png" id="p0071.png" href="#p0071.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;I shall!&rdquo; answered Harry. &ldquo;I have got sixpence,
and two pence, and a half penny, so I shall buy every one
of Laura&#8217;s letters from the postman, and write her an answer
immediately afterwards. She will like to hear, Mrs.
Crabtree, how very kind you are going to be, when I am
left by myself here. Perhaps you will play at nine pins
with me, and Laura can lend you her skipping rope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might as well offer uncle David a hobby-horse,&rdquo;
said Frank, laughingly, throwing his satchel over his shoulders.
&ldquo;No, Harry! you shall belong to me now. Grandmama
says you may go every day to my play-ground,
where all the school-boys assemble, and you can have
plenty of fun till Laura comes back. We shall jump over
the moon every morning, for joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry brightened up amazingly, thinking he had never
heard such good news before, as it was a grand piece of
promotion to play with real big school-boys; so he became
quite reconciled to Laura&#8217;s going away for a short time
without him; and when the hour came for taking leave, instead
of tears being shed on either side, it would have been
difficult to say, as they kissed each other and said a joyous
good-bye, which face looked the most delighted.</p>

<p>All Laura&#8217;s clothes had been packed the night before, in
a large chaise seat, which was now put into the carriage
along with herself, and every thing seemed ready for departure,
when Lady Harriet&#8217;s maid was suddenly taken so
very ill, as to be quite unfit for travelling; therefore she
was left behind, and a doctor sent for to attend her; while
Lady Harriet said she would trust to the maids at Holiday
House, for waiting upon herself and Laura.</p>

<p>It is seldom that so happy a face is seen in this world,
as Laura wore during the whole journey. It perfectly
sparkled and glittered with delight, while she was so constantly
on a broad grin laughing, that Major Graham said
<a name="p0072.png" id="p0072.png" href="#p0072.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>he feared her mouth would grow an inch wider on the occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will tire of sitting so long idle! It is a pity we did
not think of bringing a few lesson-books in the carriage to
amuse you, Laura,&rdquo; said the Major, slyly. &ldquo;A piece of
needle-work might have beguiled the way. I once knew
an industrious lady who made a ball dress for herself in the
carriage during a journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very stupid of her to miss seeing all the pretty
trees, and cottages, and farm-houses! I do like to watch
the little curly-headed, dirty children, playing on the road,
with brown faces, and hair bleached white in the sun; and
the women hanging out their clothes on the hedges to dry;
and the blacksmith shoeing horses, and the ducks swimming
in the gutters, and the pigs thrusting their noses out
of the sty, and the old women knitting stockings, and the
workmen sitting on a wall to eat their dinners! It looks
all so pretty, and so pleasant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a picture of rural felicity! You ought to be a
poet or a painter, Laura!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I believe poets always call this a miserable world:
and I think it the happiest place I have ever been in, uncle
David! Such fun during the holidays! I should go wild
altogether, if Mrs. Crabtree were not rather cross sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or very cross always,&rdquo; thought Major Graham. &ldquo;But
here we are, Laura, near our journey&#8217;s end. Allow me to
introduce you to Holiday House! Why, you are staring at
it like a dog looking at a piece of cold beef! My dear
girl, if you open your eyes so wide, you will never be able
to shut them again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holiday House was not one of those prodigious places,
too grand to be pleasant, with the garden a mile off in one
direction, and the farm a mile off in another, and the drawing-room
a mile off from the dining-room; but it was a
<a name="p0073.png" id="p0073.png" href="#p0073.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>very cheerful modern mansion, with rooms enough to hold
as many people as any one could desire to see at once, all
very comfortably furnished. A lively, dashing river,
streamed past the windows; a small park, sprinkled with
sheep, and shaded by fine trees, surrounded the house; and
beyond were beautiful gardens filled with a superabundance
of the gayest and sweetest common flowers. Roses,
carnations, wall flowers, holly-hocks, dahlias, lilies, and
violets, were assembled there in such crowds, that Laura
might have plucked nosegays all day, without making any
visible difference; and she was also made free of the gooseberry
bushes and cherry-trees, with leave to gather, if she
pleased, more than she could eat.</p>

<p>Every morning, Laura entered the breakfast-room with
cheeks like the roses she carried, bringing little bouquets for
all the ladies, which she had started out of bed early, in order
to gather; and her great delight was to see them worn and
admired all the forenoon, while she was complimented on
the taste with which they had been selected and arranged.
She filled every ornamental jar, basin, and tea-cup in the
drawing-room, with groups of roses, and would have been
the terror of any gardener but the one at Holiday House,
who liked to see his flowers so much admired, and was not
keeping up any for a horticultural show.</p>

<p>Laura&#8217;s chief delight, however, was in the dairy, which
seemed the most beautiful thing she had ever beheld, being
built of rough transparent spar, which looked exactly like
crystal, and reminded her of the ice palace built by the Empress
of Russia. The windows were of painted glass; the
walls and shelves were<!-- original reads "where" --> of Dutch tiles, and in the centre
rose a beautiful jet d&#8217;eau of clear bright water.</p>

<p>Laura thought it looked like something built for the fairies;
but within she<!-- original reads "see" --> saw a most substantial room, the floor
and tables in which were so completely covered with cheeses,
that they looked like some old Mosaic pavement. Here the
<a name="p0074.png" id="p0074.png" href="#p0074.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>good-natured dairy-maid showed Laura how to make cheese,
and afterwards manufactured a very small one about the
size of a soup plate, entirely for the young lady herself,
which she promised to take home after her visit was over;
and a little churn was also filled full of<!-- original reads "or" --> cream, which Laura
one morning churned into butter, and breakfasted upon, after
having first practised printing it into a variety of shapes. It
was altered about twenty times from a swan into a cow,
and from a cow into a rose, and from a rose back to a swan
again, before she could be persuaded to leave off her amusement.</p>

<p>Laura continued to become more and more delighted
with Holiday House; and she one day skipped about Lady
Harriet&#8217;s room, saying, &ldquo;Oh! I am too happy! I scarcely
know what to do with so much happiness. How delightful
it would be to stay here all my life, and never to go to
bed, nor say any more lessons as long as I live!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a useless, stupid girl you would soon become,&rdquo;
observed Lady Harriet. &ldquo;Do you think, Laura, that lessons
were invented for no other purpose but to torment little
children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, grandmama; not exactly! They are of use also to
keep us quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, little madam, and listen to me. I shall soon
be very old, Laura, and not able to read my Bible, even with
spectacles; for, as the Scriptures told us, in that affecting description
of old age, which I read to you yesterday, &lsquo;the keepers
of the house shall tremble, and the grinders cease because
they are few, and those that look out of the windows be
darkened:&rsquo; what then do you think I can do, because the
Bible now is my best comfort, which I shall need more and
more every day, to tell me all about the eternal world where
I am going, and to shew me the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmama! you promised long ago to let me attend
on you when you grow old and blind! I shall be very careful,
<a name="p0075.png" id="p0075.png" href="#p0075.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and very&mdash;very&mdash;very kind. I almost wish you were
old and blind now, to let you feel how much I love you, and
how anxious I am to be as good to you as you have always
been to me. We shall read the Bible together every morning,
and as often afterwards as you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear child! but you must take the trouble
of learning to read well, or we shall be sadly puzzled with
the difficult words. A friend of mine once had nobody
that could read to her when she was ill, but the maid, who
bargained that she might leave out every word above one
syllable long, because they were too hard for her; and you
could hardly help laughing at the nonsense it sometimes
made; but I hope you will manage better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O certainly, grandmama! I can spell chrononhotonthologos,
and all the other five-cornered words in my
&lsquo;Reading Made Easy,&rsquo; already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides that, my dear Laura! unless you learn to look
over my bills, I may be sadly cheated by servants and shop-keepers.
You must positively study to find out how many
cherries make five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! grandmama! nobody knows better than I do, that
two and two make four. I shall soon be quite able to keep
your accounts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well! but you have not yet heard half the trouble
I mean to give you. I am remarkably fond of music, and
shall probably at last be obliged to hire every old fiddler as
he passes in the street, by giving him sixpence in order to
enjoy some of my favourite tunes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, grandmama! you shall hear them all from me. I
can play Malbrook, and Auld Robin Grey, already; and
Frank says if I practise two hours every day for ten years,
I shall become a very tolerable player, fit for you and uncle
David to hear, without being disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that will be more than seven thousand hours of
musical lessons which you have yet to endure, Laura! There
<a name="p0076.png" id="p0076.png" href="#p0076.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>are many more things of still greater importance to learn
also, if you wish to be any better than a musical snuff-box.
For instance, when visitors come to see me, they are often
from France or Italy; but perhaps you will not mind sitting
in the room as if you were deaf and dumb, gazing at those
foreigners, while they gaze at you, without understanding a
syllable they say, and causing them to feel strange and uncomfortable
as long as they remain in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I would not for the world seem so unkind and
uncivil. Pray, let me learn plenty of languages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well! but if you study no geography, what ridiculous
blunders you will be falling into! asking the Italians
about their native town Madrid, and the Americans if they
were born at Petersburgh. You will be fancying that travellers
go by steam-boats to Moscow, and travel in a day
from Paris, through Stockholm to Naples. How ashamed
I should be of such mistakes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so should I, grandmama, still more than you; for
it would be quite a disgrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, Laura, your uncle David laughing,
when he last went to live at Leamington<!-- original reads "Leamingtom" -->, about poor Mrs.
Marmalade coming up stairs to say, she did not wish to be
troublesome, but should feel greatly obliged if he would call
at Portsmouth occasionally to see her son Thomas. And
when Captain Armylist&#8217;s regiment was ordered last winter
to the village of Bathgate near this, he told me they were
to march in the course of that morning, all the way to Bagdad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, grandmama! and Mrs. Crabtree said some weeks
ago, that if her brother went to Van Dieman&#8217;s Land, she
thought he would of course in passing, take a look at Jerusalem;
and Frank was amused lately to hear Peter Grey
maintain, that Gulliver was as great a man as Columbus, because
he discovered Liliput!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite like him! for I heard Peter ask one day lately,
<a name="p0077.png" id="p0077.png" href="#p0077.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>what side Bonaparte was on at the battle of Leipsic? We
must include a little history I think, Laura, in our list of
studies, or you will fancy that Lord Nelson fought at the
battle of Blenheim, and that Henry VIII. cut off Queen
Mary&#8217;s head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite so bad as that, grandmama! I seem to have
known all about Lord Nelson and Queen Mary, ever since
I was a baby in long frocks! You have shewn me, however,
that it would be very foolish not to feel anxious for lessons,
especially when they are to make me a fit companion for
you at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Laura! and not only for me, but for many whose
conversation will entertain and improve you more than any
books. The most delightful accomplishment that a young
person can cultivate, is that of conversing agreeably; and
it is less attended to in education than any other. You cannot
take a harp or piano about with you, but our minds and
tongues are always portable, and accompany us wherever we
go. If you wish to be loved by others, and to do good to
your associates, as well as to entertain them, take every opportunity
of conversing with those who are either amiable or
agreeable; not only attending to their opinions, but also
endeavouring to gain the habit of expressing your own
thoughts with ease and fluency; and then rest assured, that
if the gift of conversation be rightly exercised, it is the
most desirable of all, as no teaching can have greater influence
in leading people to think and act aright, than the incidental
remarks of an enlightened Christian, freely and
unaffectedly talking to his intimate friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, grandmama! the moral of all this is, that I shall
become busier than any body ever was before, when we get
home; but in the meantime, I may take a good dose of
idleness now at Holiday House, to prepare me for settling
to very hard labour afterwards,&rdquo; said Laura, hastily tying
<a name="p0078.png" id="p0078.png" href="#p0078.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">78</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>on her bonnet. &ldquo;I wonder if I shall ever be as merry and
happy again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most unfortunately, all the time of Laura&#8217;s visit at Holiday
House, she had been, as usual, extremely heedless, in taking
no care whatever of her clothes; consequently her blue
merino frock had been cruelly torn; her green silk dress
became frightfully soiled; four white frocks were utterly
ruined; her Swiss muslin seemed a perfect object, and her
pink gingham was both torn and discoloured. Regularly
every evening Lady Harriet told her to take better care, or
she would be a bankrupt in frocks altogether; but whatever
her grandmama said on that subject, the moment she was
out of sight, it went out of mind, till another dress had
shared the same deplorable fate.</p>

<p>At last, one morning, as soon as Laura got up, Lady
Harriet gravely led her towards a large table on which all the
ill-used frocks had been laid out in a row; and a most dismal
sight they were! Such a collection of stains and fractures
was probably never seen before! A beggar would
scarcely have thanked her for her blue merino; and the
green silk frock looked like the tattered cover of a worn-out
umbrella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura,&rdquo; said Lady Harriet, &ldquo;in Switzerland a lady&#8217;s
wardrobe descends to many generations; but nobody will
envy your successor! One might fancy that a wild beast
had torn you to pieces every day! I wonder what an old
clothesman would give for your whole baggage! It is only
fit for being used as rags in a paper manufactory!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Laura&#8217;s face became perfectly pink when she saw
the destruction that a very short time had occasioned: and
she looked from one tattered garment to another, in melancholy
silence, thinking how lately they had all been fresh
and beautiful; but now not a vestige of their former splendour
remained. At last her grandmama broke the awful
silence, by saying,</p>

<p><a name="p0079.png" id="p0079.png" href="#p0079.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;My dear girl! I have warned you very often lately that
we are not at home, where your frocks could be washed and
mended as soon as they were spoiled; but without considering
this you have, every day, destroyed several, so now
the maid finds, on examining your drawers, that there is
only one clean frock remaining!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura looked gravely at the last clean frock, and wondered
much what her grandmama would say next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to make a prisoner of you at home during
this very fine weather, yet in five minutes after leaving the
house, you will, of course, become unfit to be seen, which
I should very much regret, as a number of fine people
are coming to dinner, whom you would like to see.
The great General Courteney, and all his Aide-de-Camps,
intend to be here on their way from a review,
besides many officers and ladies who know your papa very
well, and wish to see my little grand-daughter; but I would
not on any account allow you to appear before them, looking
like a perfect tatterdemalion, as you too often do.
They would suppose you had been drawn backwards through
a hedge! Now my plan is, that you shall wear this old
pink gingham for romping all morning in the garden, and
dress in your last clean frock for dinner; but remember to
keep out of sight till then. Remain within the garden
walls, as none of the company will be walking there, but be
sure to avoid the terrace and shrubberies till you are made
tidy, for I shall be both angry and mortified if your papa&#8217;s
friends see you for the first time looking like rag-fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura promised to remember her grandmama&#8217;s injunctions,
and to remain invisible all morning; so off she set
to the garden, singing and skipping with joy, as she ran
towards her pleasant hiding-place, planning twenty ways in
which the day might be delightfully spent alone. Before
long she had strung a long necklace of daisies&mdash;she had
put many bright leaves in a book to dry&mdash;she had made a
<a name="p0080.png" id="p0080.png" href="#p0080.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">80</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>large ball of cowslips to toss in the air&mdash;she had watered
the hyacinths, with a watering-pot, till they were nearly
washed away&mdash;she had plucked more roses than could possibly
be carried, and eat as many gooseberries and cherries
as it was convenient to swallow,&mdash;but still there were several
hours remaining to be enjoyed, and nothing very particular,
that Laura could think of, to do.</p>

<p>Meantime, the miserable pink frock was torn worse than
ever, and seemed to be made of nothing but holes, for
every gooseberry-bush in the garden had got a share of it.
Laura wished pink gingham frocks had never been invented,
and wondered why nothing stronger could be made!
Having become perfectly tired of the garden, she now
wished herself anywhere else in the world, and thought she
was no better off, confined in this way within four walls,
than a canary bird in a cage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like so much to go, if it were only for five
minutes, on the terrace!&rdquo; said she to herself. &ldquo;How much
pleasanter it is than this. Grandmama did not care where
I went, provided nobody saw me! I may at least take a
peep to see if any one is there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura now cautiously opened the garden-door, and put her
head out, intending only to look for a moment, but the moment
grew longer and longer, till it stretched into ten minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What crowds of fine people are walking about on the
terrace!&rdquo; thought she. &ldquo;It looks as gay as a fair! Who
can that officer be in a red coat, and cocked hat with white
feathers. Probably General Courteney paying attention to
Lady Rockville. There is a lady in a blue cloak and blue
flowers! how very pretty! Everybody is so exceedingly
smart! and I see some little boys too! Grandmama never
told me any children were coming! I wonder how old
they are, and if they will play with me in the evening! It
would be very amusing to venture a little nearer, and get a
better glimpse of them all!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0081.png" id="p0081.png" href="#p0081.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">81</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>If Laura&#8217;s wishes pointed one way and her duty pointed
the other, it was a very sad thing how often she forgot to
pause and consider which she ought to follow; and on this
occasion, as usual, she took the naughty side of the question,
and prepared to indulge her curiosity, though very
anxious that nothing might happen to displease her grandmama.
She observed at some distance on the terrace, a
remarkably large thick holly-bush, near which the great procession
of company would probably pass before long,
therefore, hoping nobody could possibly see her there, she
stole hastily out of the garden, and concealed herself behind
it; but when children do wrong, in hopes of not being
found out, they generally find themselves mistaken, as
Laura soon discovered to her cost. It is very lucky, however,
for the culprits, when they are detected, that they may learn
never to behave so foolishly again, because the greatest
misfortune that can happen to a child is, not to be found
out and punished when he does wrong.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Laura had taken her station behind
the holly-bush, crowds of ladies and officers came strolling
along, so very near her hiding-place, that she saw them all
distinctly, and felt excessively amused and delighted at
first, to be perched like a bird in a tree watching this grand
party, while nobody saw her, nor guessed that she was
there. Presently, however, Laura became sadly frightened
when an officer in a scarlet coat happened to look towards
the holly-bush, and exclaimed, with some surprise,</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is surely something very odd about that plant!
I see large pink spots between the leaves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Captain Digby, you are quite mistaken,&rdquo; answered
one of the ladies, dressed in a bright yellow bonnet
and green pelisse. &ldquo;I see nothing particular there! only
a common ugly bush of holly! I wonder you ever thought
of noticing it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Perceval! there certainly is something very
<a name="p0082.png" id="p0082.png" href="#p0082.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">82</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>curious behind! I would bet five to one there is!&rdquo; replied
Captain Digby, stepping up, close to the holly-bush,
and peeping over: &ldquo;What have we here! a ragged little
girl, I do believe! in a pink frock!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Laura was now in a terrible scrape; she started up
immediately to run away. Probably she never ran so fast
in her life before, but Captain Digby was a person who enjoyed
a joke, so he called out</p>

<p class="ctr smaller">&ldquo;Tally-ho! a race for a thousand pounds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off set the Captain, and away flew Laura. At any other
time she would have thought it capital fun, but now she
was frightened out of her wits, and tore away at the very
top of her speed. The whole party of ladies and gentlemen
stood laughing, and applauding, to see how fast they
both cleared the ground, while Laura, seeing the garden
gate still wide open, hoped she might be able to dart in,
and close it, but alas! when she arrived within four steps
of the threshold, feeling almost certain of escape, Captain
Digby seized hold of her pink frock behind. It instantly
began tearing, so she had great hopes of leaving the piece
in his hand and getting off; but he was too clever for that,
as he grasped hold of her long sash, which was floating far
out behind, and led Laura a prisoner before the whole company.</p>

<p>When Lady Harriet discovered that this was really Laura
advancing, her head hanging down, her hair streaming
about her ears, and her face like a full moon, she could
scarcely credit her own eyes, and held her hands up with
astonishment, while uncle David shrugged his shoulders,
till they almost met over his head, but not a word was said
on either side until they got home, when Lady Harriet at
last broke the awful silence by saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl! you must, of course, be severely punished
for this act of disobedience, and it is not so much on
<a name="p0083.png" id="p0083.png" href="#p0083.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">83</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>account of feeling angry at your misconduct that I mean to
correct you, but because I love you, and wish to make you
behave better in future. Parents are appointed by God to
govern their children as he governs us, not carelessly indulging
their faults, but wisely correcting them, for we are told
that our Great Father in heaven chastens those whom he
loves, and only afflicts us for great and wise purposes. I
have suffered many sorrows in the world, but they always
made me better in the end, and whatever discipline you meet
with from me, or from that Great Being who loves you still
more than I do, let it teach you to consider your ways, to
repent of your wilfulness, and to pray that you may be enabled
to act more properly in future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, grandmama,&rdquo; replied Laura, with tears in her eyes,
&ldquo;I am quite willing to be punished, for it was very wrong
indeed to make you so vexed and ashamed, by disobeying
your orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then here is a long task which you must study before
dinner, as a penalty for trespassing bounds. It is a beautiful
poem on the death of Sir John Moore, which every
school-girl can repeat, but being rather long, you will scarcely
have time to learn it perfectly, before coming down to
dessert, therefore, that you may be quite ready, I shall ring
now for Lady Rockville&#8217;s maid, and have you washed and
dressed immediately. Remember this is your last clean
frock, and be sure not to spoil it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Laura chose to pay attention, she could learn her
lessons wonderfully fast, and her eyes seemed nailed to the
book for some time after Lady Harriet went away, till at
last she could repeat the whole poem perfectly well. It was
neither &ldquo;slowly nor sadly&rdquo; that Laura &ldquo;laid down&rdquo; her book,
after practising it all, in a sort of jig time, till she could rattle
over the poem like a rail-road, and she walked to the
window, still murmuring the verses to herself with prodigious
<a name="p0084.png" id="p0084.png" href="#p0084.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">84</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>glee, and giving little thought to their melancholy
subject.</p>

<p>A variety of plans suggested themselves to her mind for
amusing herself within doors, as she had been forbidden to
venture out, and she lost no time in executing them. First,
she tried on all her grandmama&#8217;s caps at a looking-glass,
none of which were improved by being crushed and tumbled
in such a way. Then she quarrelled with Lady Rockville&#8217;s
beautiful cockatoo, till it bit her finger violently, and
after that, she teazed the old cat till it scratched her; but all
these diversions were not sufficiently entertaining, so Laura
began to grow rather tired, till at last she went to gaze out
at the portico of Holiday House, being perfectly determined,
on no account whatever, to go one single step farther.</p>

<p>Here Laura saw many things which entertained her extremely,
for she had scarcely ever seen more of the country
than was to be enjoyed with Mrs. Crabtree in Charlotte
Square. The punctual crows were all returning home at
their usual hour for the evening, and looked like a black
shower over her head, while hundreds of them seemed trying
to make a concert at once; the robins hopped close to
her feet, evidently accustomed to be fed; a tame pheasant,
as fat as a London alderman, came up the steps to keep her
company; and the peacock, spreading his tail, and strutting
about, looked the very picture of silly pride and vanity.</p>

<p>Laura admired and enjoyed all this extremely, and crumbled
down nearly a loaf of bread, which she scattered on the
ground, in order to be popular among her visitors, who took
all they could get from her, and quarrelled among themselves
about it, very much as boys and girls would perhaps have
done in the same circumstances.</p>

<p>It happened at this moment, that a large flock of geese
crossed the park, on their way towards the river, stalking
along in a slow majestic manner, with their heads high in
the air. Laura observed them at a distance, and thought
<a name="p0085.png" id="p0085.png" href="#p0085.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>they were the prettiest creatures in the world, with their pure
white feathers and yellow stockings, so she wondered what
kind of birds these were, having never seen a goose before,
except when roasted for dinner, though, indeed, she was a
sad goose herself, as will very soon be told.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I should like to examine those large, white, beautiful
birds, a little nearer,&rdquo; thought Laura to herself. &ldquo;I
wonder if they could swim or fly!&mdash;oh! how perfect they
would look, floating like water-lilies on the river, and then
I might take a bit of bread to throw in, and they would all
rush after it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura, as usual, did not wait to reflect what her grandmama
might be likely to think; indeed it is to be feared
Laura forgot at the moment that she had a grandmama at
all, for her mind was never large enough to hold more than
one thing at a time, and now it was entirely filled with the
flock of geese. She instantly set off in pursuit of them,
and began chasing the whole party across the park, making
all sorts of dreadful noises, in hopes they might fly; but, on
the contrary, they held up their heads, as if she had been a
dancing-master, and marched slowly on, cackling loudly to
each other, and evidently getting extremely angry.</p>

<p>Laura was now quite close to her new acquaintances, and
even threw a pebble to hurry them forward, when suddenly
an old gander stopped, and turned round in a terrible rage.
The whole flock of geese then did the same, after which
they flew towards Laura, with their bills wide open, hissing
furiously, and stretching out their long necks in an angry
menacing way, as if they wished to tear her in pieces.</p>

<p>Poor Laura became frightened out of any wits she ever
had, and ran off, with all the geese after her! Anybody
must have laughed into fits, could they have heard what a
triumphant cackle the geese set up, and had they seen how
fast she flew away. If Laura had borrowed a pair of wings
<a name="p0086.png" id="p0086.png" href="#p0086.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>from her pursuers, she could scarcely have got more quickly
on.</p>

<p>In the hurry of escaping, she always looked back to see
if the enemy followed, and scarcely observed which way she
ran herself, till suddenly her foot stumbled over a large stone,
and she fell headlong into the river!&mdash;oh, what a scream
Laura gave! it terrified even the old gander himself, and
sent the whole flock of geese marching off, nearly as fast
as they had come; but Laura&#8217;s cries also reached, at a great
distance, the ears of somebody, who she would have been
very sorry to think had heard them.</p>

<p>Lady Harriet, and all her friends at Holiday House, were
taking a delightful walk under some fine old fir trees, on the
banks of the river, admiring the beautiful scenery, while
Miss Perceval was admiring nothing but her own fine pocket
handkerchief, which had cost ten guineas, being worked
with her name, trimmed with lace, and perfumed with eau
de Cologne; and Captain Digby was admiring his own
scarlet uniform, reflected in the bright clear water, and varying
his employment occasionally by throwing pebbles into
the stream, to see how far they would go. Suddenly, however,
he stopped, with a look of surprise and alarm, saying,
&ldquo;What noise can that be!&mdash;a loud scream in the water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no! it was only one of those horrid peacocks,&rdquo;
answered Miss Perceval, waving her fine pocket handkerchief.
&ldquo;They are the most disagreeable, noisy creatures
in the world! If mama ever keeps one, I shall get him a
singing-master, or put a muzzle on his mouth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely there is something splashing in the river at
a great distance. Do you not see that!&mdash;what can it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, depend upon it! I could bet the value
of my pocket handkerchief, ten guineas, that it is nothing.
Officers who live constantly in barracks are so unaccustomed
to the country, that they seem to expect something
<a name="p0087.png" id="p0087.png" href="#p0087.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>wonderful shall happen every minute! That is probably a salmon
or a minnow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am determined, however, to see. If you are quite
sure this is a salmon, will you promise to eat for your dinner
whatever we find, provided I can catch it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly! unless you catch a whale! Oh! I have
dropped my pocket handkerchief,&mdash;pray pick it up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Digby did so; but without waiting to examine
the pattern, he instantly ran forward, and to his own very
great astonishment, saw Laura up to her knees in the river,
trying to scramble out, while her face was white with terror,
and her limbs trembled with cold, like a poodle dog newly
washed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here you are again!&mdash;the very same little girl that
I caught in the morning,&rdquo; cried he, laughing heartily, while
he carefully pulled Laura towards the bank, though, by doing
so, he splashed his beautiful uniform most distressingly.
&ldquo;We have had a complete game at bo-peep to-day, my friend!
but here comes a lady who has promised to eat you up,
therefore I shall have no more trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura would have consented to be eaten up with pleasure,
rather than encounter Lady Harriet&#8217;s eye, who really did
not recognize her for the first minute, as no one can suppose
what a figure she appeared. The last clean frock had
been covered entirely over with mud&mdash;her hair was dripping
with water&mdash;and her new yellow sash might be any colour
in the world. Laura felt so completely ashamed she could
not look up from the ground, and so sorry she could not
speak, while hot tears mingled themselves with the cold water
which trickled down her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter! Who is this?&rdquo; cried Lady Harriet,
hurrying up to the place where they stood. &ldquo;Laura!! Impossible!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me put on a pair of spectacles, for I cannot believe
my eyes without them!&rdquo; said Major Graham. &ldquo;Ah! sure
<a name="p0088.png" id="p0088.png" href="#p0088.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>enough it is Laura, and such a looking Laura as I never
saw before. You must have had a nice cold bath!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; continued Lady Harriet, &ldquo;that naughty
people are often ducked in the water as a punishment, and
in that respect I am sure Laura deserves what she has got,
and a great deal more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She reminds me,&rdquo; observed Captain Digby, &ldquo;of the
Chinese bird which has no legs, so it constantly flies about
from place to place, never a moment at rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me, Laura,&rdquo; said Lady Harriet, &ldquo;that I may
hear whether you have anything to say for yourself on this
occasion. It is scarcely possible that there can be any excuse,
but nobody should be condemned unheard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Laura had been put into dry clothes, she told her
whole history, and entreated Lady Harriet to hear how very
perfectly she had first learned her task, before venturing to
stir out of the room; upon which her grandmama consented,
and amidst tears and sobs, the monody on Sir John Moore
was repeated without a single mistake. Lady Rockville
then came in, to entreat that, as this was the last day of the
visit to Holiday House, Laura might be forgiven and permitted
to appear at dessert, as all the company were anxious
to see her, and particularly Captain Digby, who regretted
that he had been the means at first of getting her into a
scrape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my dear Lady Rockville! I might perhaps
have agreed to your wishes,&rdquo; answered Lady Harriet,
&ldquo;particularly as Laura seems sincerely sorry, and did not
premeditate her disobedience; but she actually has not a
tolerable frock to appear in now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must lend her one of my velvet dresses to destroy
next,&rdquo; said Lady Rockville, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David&#8217;s Mackintosh cloak would be the fittest
thing for her to wear,&rdquo; replied Lady Harriet, rising to leave
the room. &ldquo;Laura, you must learn a double task now!
<a name="p0089.png" id="p0089.png" href="#p0089.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Here it is! and at Lady Rockville&#8217;s request I excuse you
this once; though I am sorry that, for very sufficient reasons,
we cannot see you at dessert, which otherwise I should
have been most happy to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura sat down and cried during a quarter of an hour after
Lady Harriet had gone to dinner. She felt sorry for having
behaved ill, and sorry to have vexed her good grandmama;
and sorry not to see all the fine party at dessert; and sorry
to think that next day she must leave Holiday House; and
sorry, last of all, to consider what Mrs. Crabtree would say
when all her ruined frocks were brought home. In short,
poor Laura felt perfectly overwhelmed with the greatness
and variety of her griefs, and scarcely believed that any one
in the world was ever more miserable than herself.</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on her task, while her thoughts were
wandering fifty miles away from it, when a housemaid, who
had frequently attended upon Laura during her visit, accidentally
entered the room, and seemed much surprised, as
well as concerned, to find the young lady in such a way,
for her sobbing could be heard in the next room. It was
quite a relief to see any one; so Laura told over again all
the sad adventures of the day, without attempting to conceal
how naughty she had been; and most attentively was her
narrative listened to, till the very end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Miss!&rdquo; observed Nelly, &ldquo;when people
doesn&#8217;t behave well, they must expect to be punished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they should!&rdquo; sobbed Laura; &ldquo;and I dare say it
will make me better! I would not pass such a miserable
day as this again, for the world; but I deserve to be more
punished than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s right, Miss!&rdquo; replied Nelly, pleased to see the
good effect of her admonitions. &ldquo;Punishment is as sure
to do us good when we are naughty, as physic when we
are ill. But now you&#8217;ll go down to dessert, and forget it
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0090.png" id="p0090.png" href="#p0090.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;No! grandmama would have allowed me, and Lady
Rockville and every body was so very kind about inviting
me down; but my last clean frock is quite unfit to be seen,
so I have none to put on. Oh, dear! what a thousand
million of pities!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all, Miss! Then dry your eyes, and I can wash
the frock in ten minutes. Give it to me, and learn your
lesson, so as to be ready when I come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura sprung off her seat with joy at this proposal, and
ran&mdash;or rather flew&mdash;to fetch her miserable object of a frock,
which Nelly crumpled under her arm, and walked away
with, in such haste that she was evidently determined to return
very soon; while Laura took her good advice, and sat
down to learn her task, though she could hardly look at
the book during two minutes at a time&mdash;she watched so
impatiently for her benefactress from the laundry.</p>

<p>At length the door flew open, and in walked Nelly, whose
face looked as red and hot as a beefsteak; but in her hand
she carried a basket, on which was laid out, in great state,
the very cleanest frock that ever was seen! It perfectly
smelled of soap and water, starch and hot irons, and seemed
still almost smoking from the laundry; while Laura
looked at it with such delight and admiration, it might have
been supposed she never saw a clean frock before.</p>

<p>When Lady Harriet was sitting after dinner that day,
sipping her wine, and thinking about no thing very particular,
she became surprised to feel somebody gently twitching
her sleeve to attract notice. Turning instantly round to
ascertain what was the matter, and who it could be, what
was her astonishment to see Laura at her elbow, looking
rather shy and frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get here, child!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Harriet,
in accents of amazement, though almost laughing.
&ldquo;Am I never to see the last of you to-day! Where did you
<a name="p0091.png" id="p0091.png" href="#p0091.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">91</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>get that frock! It must have dropped from the clouds!
Or did some good fairy give you a new one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That good fairy was Nelly the housemaid,&rdquo; whispered
Laura. &ldquo;She first tossed my frock into a washing-tub;
and then at the great kitchen fire she toasted it, <span class="nw">and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;And buttered it, I hope,&rdquo; added Major Graham.
&ldquo;Come here, Laura! I can read what is written
in your grandmama&#8217;s face at this moment; and it says, &lsquo;you
are a tiresome little puss, that nobody can keep in any order
except uncle David;&rsquo; therefore sit down beside him, and
eat as many almonds and raisins as he bids you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a nice, funny uncle David!&rdquo; whispered Laura,
crushing her way in between his chair and Miss Perceval&#8217;s,
&ldquo;nobody will need a tongue now, if you can read so
exactly what we are all thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But here is Miss Perceval, still more wonderful; for
she knows by the bumps on your head, all that is contained
inside. Let me see if I could do so! There is a large
bump of reading, and a small one of writing and arithmetic.
Here is a terrible organ of breaking dolls and destroying
frocks. There is a very small bump of liking uncle
David, and a prodigious one of liking almonds and raisins!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! you are quite mistaken! It is the largest bump
for loving uncle David, and the small one for every thing
else,&rdquo; interrupted Laura, eagerly. &ldquo;I shall draw a map of
my head some day, to show you how it is all divided.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="nobot">&ldquo;And leave no room for any thing naughty or foolish!
Your head should be swept out, and put in order every
morning, that not a single cobweb may remain in your
brains. What busy brains they must be for the next ten
years! But in the meantime let us hope that you will never
again be reduced to your</p>

<div>There was a young pickle, and what do you think?</div>
<div>He liv&#8217;d upon nothing but victuals and drink;</div>
<div>Victuals and drink were the chief of his diet,</div>
<div>And yet this young pickle could never be quiet.</div>

<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">One</span> fine sultry day in the month of August, Harry and
Laura stood at the breakfast-room window, wondering to
see the large broken white clouds, looking like curds and
whey, while the sun was in such a blaze of heat, that every
thing seemed almost red hot. The street door had become
blistered by the sun-beams. Jowler the dog lay basking on
the pavement; the green blinds were closed at every opposite
house; the few gentlemen who ventured out, were fanning
themselves with their pocket handkerchiefs; the ladies
were strolling lazily along, under the umbrageous shade of
their green parasols; and the poor people who were accustomed
in winter to sell matches for lighting a fire, now
carried about gaudy paper hangings for the empty grates.
Lady Harriet found the butter so melted at breakfast, that
she could scarcely lift it on her knife; and uncle David
complained that the sight of hot smoking tea put him in a
fever, and said he wished it could be iced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how iced porridge would taste!&rdquo; said Harry.
&ldquo;I put mine at the open window to cool, but that only
made it seem hotter. We were talking of the gentleman
<a name="p0093.png" id="p0093.png" href="#p0093.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">93</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>you mentioned yesterday, who toasted his muffins at a volcano;
and certainly yours might almost be done at the
drawing-room window this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till you arrive at the countries I have visited,
where, as somebody remarked, the very salamanders die of
heat. At Agra, which is the hottest part of India, we could
scarcely write a letter, because the ink dries in the pen before
you can get it to the paper. I was obliged, when our regiment
was there, to lie down in the middle of the day, during
several hours, actually gasping for breath; and to make up
for that, we all rose at midnight. An officer of ours, who
lived long in India, got up always at three in the morning,
after we returned home, and walked about the streets of
Portsmouth, wondering what had become of everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall try not to grumble about weather any more,&rdquo;
said Laura. &ldquo;We seem no worse off than other people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or rather we are a great deal better off! At Bermuda,
where my regiment stopped on the way to America, the
inhabitants are so tormented with high winds, that they
build &lsquo;hurricane houses&rsquo;&mdash;low, flat rooms, where the families
must retire when a storm comes on, as trees, houses,
people, and cattle, are all whirled about with such violence,
that not a life is safe on the island while it lasts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Lady Harriet, &ldquo;of a droll
mistake made yesterday by the African camel, when he
landed at Leith. His keepers were leading him along the
high road to be made a show of in Edinburgh, at a time
when the wind was particularly high; and the poor animal
encountering such clouds of dust, thought this must be a
simoon of the desert, and threw himself flat down, burying
his nose in the ground, according to custom on those occasions.
It was with great difficulty that he could at last be
induced to face the danger, and proceed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a compliment to our dust,&rdquo; observed Laura.
&ldquo;But really in such a hot day, the kangaroos and tigers
<a name="p0094.png" id="p0094.png" href="#p0094.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>might feel perfectly at home here. Oh! how I should like
to visit the <em>Geo</em>logical Gardens in London!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then suppose we set off immediately!&rdquo; said Major
Graham, pretending to rise from his chair. &ldquo;Your grandmama&#8217;s
donkey-carriage holds two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! but you could carry the donkey-carriage more
easily than it could carry you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I try? Well, if we go, who is to pay the turnpikes,
for I remember the time, not a hundred years ago,
when Harry and you both thought that paying the gates was
the only expense of travelling. You asked me then how
poor grandmama could afford so many shillings and sixpences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know all about every thing now though!&rdquo; said
Harry, nodding in a very sagacious manner. &ldquo;I can tell
exactly how much time it takes going by the public coach
to London, and it sleeps only one night on the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleeps!&rdquo; cried uncle David. &ldquo;What! it puts on a
night-cap, and goes to bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! and it dines and breakfasts too, Mr. uncle David,
for I heard Mrs. Crabtree say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never name anybody, unless you wish to see her immediately,&rdquo;
said Major Graham, hearing a well-known tap
at the door. &ldquo;As sure as you mention an absent person, if
he is supposed to be fifty miles off at the time, it is rather
odd, but he instantly appears!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is somebody that I shall speak about very
often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can this Mr. Somebody be?&rdquo; asked uncle David,
smiling. &ldquo;A foolish person that spoils you both I dare say,
and gives you large slices of bread and jelly like this.
Hold them carefully! Now, good bye, and joy be with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was with rather rueful faces that Harry and Laura
left the room, wishing they might have remained another
<a name="p0095.png" id="p0095.png" href="#p0095.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">95</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>hour to talk nonsense with uncle David, and dreading to
think what new scrapes and difficulties they would get into
in the nursery, which always seemed to them a place of torture
and imprisonment.</p>

<p>Major Graham used to say that Mrs. Crabtree should always
have a thermometer in her own room when she
dressed, to tell her whether the weather was hot or cold, for
she seemed to feel no difference, and scarcely ever made
any change in her own attire, wearing always the same
pink gown and scarlet shawl, which made her look like a
large red flower-pot, while she was no more annoyed with
the heat than a flower-pot would have been. On this very oppressive
morning she took as much pains in suffocating
Harry with a silk handkerchief round his neck, as if it had
been Christmas, and though Laura begged hard for leave to
go without one of her half-a-dozen wrappings, she might as
well have asked permission to go without her head, as Mrs.
Crabtree seemed perfectly deaf upon the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This day is so very cold and so very shivering,&rdquo; said
Harry, slyly, &ldquo;that I suppose you will make Laura wear at
least fifty shawls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not above twenty,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Crabtree, dryly.
&ldquo;Give me no more of your nonsense, Master Harry!
This is no business of yours! I was in the world long before
you were born, and must know best; so hold your
tongue. None but fools and beggars need ever be cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Crabtree had heaped as many clothes upon
her two little victims, as she was pleased to think necessary;
so she sallied forth with them, followed by Betty, and
proceeded towards the country, taking the sunny side of the
road, and raising clouds of dust at every step, till Harry and
Laura felt as if they had been made of wax, and were melting
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Crabtree!&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;did you hear uncle
David&#8217;s funny story yesterday? One hot morning a
<a name="p0096.png" id="p0096.png" href="#p0096.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">96</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>gentleman was watching an ant&#8217;s nest, when he observed, that
every little insect, as it came out, plucked a small leaf, to
hold over its head, as a parasol! I wish we could find
leaves large enough for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go to the Botanical Gardens, where one leaf
of a palm-tree was shown to grandmama, which measured
fourteen feet long,&rdquo; observed Laura. &ldquo;How horrid these
very warm countries must be, where the heat is all the year
round like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well say that,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Crabtree. &ldquo;I
would not go to them East Indies&mdash;no! not if I were Governess-General,&mdash;to
be running away with a tiger at your
back, and sleeping with real live serpents twisted round the
bed-post, and scorpions under your pillow! Catch me
there! I&#8217;m often quite sorry for Master Frank, to think
that his ship is maybe going that way! I&#8217;m told the very rats
have such a smell in that outlandish place, that if they
touch the outside of a bottle with their tails, it tastes of musk
ever after; and when people are sitting comfortably down,
expecting to enjoy their dinner, a swarm of great ants will
come, and fall, an inch thick, on all the side-dishes. I&#8217;ve
no desire whatever to see foreign parts!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wish to see every country in the universe,&rdquo; said
Harry; &ldquo;and I hope there will be a rail-road all round the
world before I am grown up. Only think, Mrs. Crabtree,
what fun lion-hunting must be, and catching dolphins, and
riding on elephants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pedestrians had now arrived at the pretty village of Corstorphine,
when they were unexpectedly met by Peter Grey,
who joined them without waiting to ask leave. Here the hills
are so beautifully wooded, and the villas so charming, that
Harry, Peter, and Laura stopped a moment, to consider
what house they would like best to live in. Near one side
of the road stood a large cart of hay, on the top of which
were several men, forking it in at the window of a high loft,
<a name="p0097.png" id="p0097.png" href="#p0097.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">97</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>which could only be entered by a long ladder that leaned
against the wall. It was a busy joyous scene, and soon attracted
the children&#8217;s whole attention, who were transfixed
with delight, seeing how rapidly the people ran up and down,
with their pitchforks in their hands, and tilted the hay from
the cart into the loft, while they had many jokes and much
laughter among themselves. At last their whole business
was finished, and the workmen drove away for another supply,
to the neighbouring fields, where they had been raking
and tossing it all morning, as merry as crickets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happy people!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, looking wistfully
after the party, and wishing he might have scrambled
into the cart beside them. &ldquo;I would be a haymaker for
nothing, if anybody would employ me; would not you,
Peter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very strange,&rdquo; said Master Grey, &ldquo;why little ladies
and gentlemen seem always obliged to endure a perfectly
useless walk every day, as you and Laura are doing now.
You never saw animals set out to take a stroll for the good
of their healths! How odd it would be to see a couple of
dogs set off for a country walk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Laura!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crabtree, &ldquo;Master Harry may
rest here for a minute or two with Master Peter, and let
them count their fingers, while you come with Betty and
me to visit a sick old aunt of mine who lives round the corner;
but be sure, boys, you do not presume to wander about,
or I shall punish you most severely. We are coming back
in two minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crabtree had scarcely disappeared into a small shabby-looking
cottage, before Peter turned eagerly to Harry,
with a face of great joy and importance, exclaiming, &ldquo;Only
see how very lucky this is! The haymakers have left their
long ladder, standing on purpose for us! The window of
that loft is wide open, and I must climb up immediately to
<a name="p0098.png" id="p0098.png" href="#p0098.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">98</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>peep in, because never, in all my life, did I see the inside
of a hay-loft before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I!&rdquo; added Harry. &ldquo;Uncle David says, that all
round the floor there are deep holes, called mangers, down
which food is thrown for the horses, so that they can thrust
their heads in, to take a bite, whenever they choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I should hate to have my dinner hung up always
before my nose in that way! Suppose the kitchen were placed
above your nursery, and that Mrs. Marmalade showered
down tarts and puddings, which were to remain there till
you ate them, you would hate the sight of such things at last.
But now, Harry, for the hay-loft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter scrambled so rapidly up the ladder, that he soon
reached the top, and instantly vanished in at the window,
calling eagerly for Harry to follow. &ldquo;You never saw such
a nice, clean, funny place as this, in all your life!&mdash;make
haste!&mdash;come faster!&mdash;never mind crushing your hat or
tearing your jacket,&mdash;I&#8217;ll put it all to rights. Ah! there!&mdash;that&#8217;s
the thing!&mdash;walk up, gentlemen! walk up!&mdash;the grand
show!&mdash;sixpence each, and children half-price!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time, Harry was slowly, and with great difficulty,
picking his steps up the ladder, but a most troublesome business
it was! First, his foot became entangled in a rope,&mdash;then
his hat got squeezed so out of shape, it looked perfectly
tipsy,&mdash;next, one of his shoes nearly came off,&mdash;and
afterwards he dropped his gloves; but at last he stumbled up
in safety, and stood beside Peter in the loft, both laughing
with delight at their own enterprize.</p>

<p>The quantity of hay piled up on all sides, astonished them
greatly, while the nice, wide floor between, seemed larger
than any drawing-room, and was certainly made on purpose
for a romp. Harry rolled up a large ball of hay to throw at
Peter, while he, in return, aimed at him, so they ran after
each other, round and round the loft, raising such a riot,
that the very &ldquo;rafters dirled.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0099.png" id="p0099.png" href="#p0099.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">99</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>The hay now flew about in clouds, while they jumped
over it, or crept under it, throwing handfuls about in every
direction, and observing that this was the best play-room
they had ever been in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lucky that we came here!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I
should like to stay an hour at least!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! two hours,&mdash;or three,&mdash;or all day,&rdquo; added Harry.
&ldquo;But what shall we do about Mrs. Crabtree? She has not
gone to settle for life with that old sick aunt, so I am afraid
we must really be hurrying back, in case she may find out
our expedition, and that, you know, Peter, would be dreadful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only fancy, Harry, if she sees you and me clinging to
the ladder, about half way down! what a way she would be
in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better make haste,&rdquo; said Harry, looking around.
&ldquo;What would grandmama say!&mdash;I wish we had never come
up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, Harry was still more brought to his
senses, by hearing Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s voice, exclaiming, in
loud angry accents, &ldquo;Where in all the world can those
troublesome boys be gone! I must tether them to a tree
the next time they are left together! Why! sure! they
would not venture up that long ladder in the hay-loft! If
they have, they had better never come down again, for I
shall shew who is master here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter Grey would run up a ladder to the stars, if he
could find one,&rdquo; replied Betty. &ldquo;Here are Master Harry&#8217;s
gloves lying at the bottom of it. They can be gone nowhere
else, for I have searched every other place. We
must send the town-crier with his bell after them, if they
are not found up there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crabtree now seemed fearfully angry, while Laura
began to tremble with fright for Harry, who was listening
overhead, and did not know very well what to do, but
<a name="p0100.png" id="p0100.png" href="#p0100.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">100</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>foolishly thought it best to put off the evil hour of being punished
as long as possible; so he and Peter silently crept in
below a great quantity of hay, and hid themselves so cunningly,
that even a thief-catcher could scarcely have discovered
their den. In this dark corner, Harry had time to
reflect and to feel more and more alarmed and sorry for his
misconduct, so he said, in a very distressed voice, &ldquo;Oh,
Peter! what a pity it is ever to be naughty, for we are always
found out, and always so much happier when we are
good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how Mrs. Crabtree will get up the long ladder?&rdquo;
whispered Peter, laughing. &ldquo;I would give my little
finger, and one of my ears, to see her and Betty scrambling
along!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry had to pinch Peter&#8217;s arm almost black and blue
before he would be quiet; and by the time he stopped talking,
Mrs. Crabtree and Betty were both standing in the
hay-loft, exceedingly out of breath with climbing so unusually
high, while Mrs. Crabtree very nearly fell, having
stumbled over a step at the entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sure! there&#8217;s nobody here!&rdquo; exclaimed she, in a
disappointed tone. &ldquo;And what a disorderly place this is!
I thought a hay-loft was always kept in such nice order, with
the floor all swept! but here is a fine mess! Those two great
lumps of hay in the corner look as if they were meant for
people to sleep upon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry gave himself up for lost when Mrs. Crabtree noticed
the place where he and Peter had buried themselves
alive; but to his great relief, no suspicion seemed to have
been excited, and neither of the two searchers were anxious
to venture beyond the door, after having so nearly tripped
upon the threshold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must have been stolen by a gipsey, or perhaps
fallen into a well,&rdquo; said Betty, who rather liked the bustle of
an accident. &ldquo;I always thought Master Peter would break
<a name="p0101.png" id="p0101.png" href="#p0101.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">101</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>his neck, or something of that kind. Poor thing! how distressed
his papa will be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Crabtree, angrily.
&ldquo;I wish people would either speak sense, or not speak at
all! Did you hear a noise among the hay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats, I dare say! or perhaps a dog!&rdquo; answered Betty,
turning hastily round, and hurrying down the ladder faster
than she had come up. &ldquo;I certainly thought something
moved in yon far corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where can that little shrimp of a boy be hid?&rdquo; added
Mrs. Crabtree, following. &ldquo;He must have obedience
knocked like a nail into his head, with a few good severe
blows. I shall beat him to powder when once we catch
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may depend upon it,&rdquo; persisted Betty, &ldquo;that some
gipsey has got the boys for the sake of their clothes. It
will be a great pity, because Master Harry had on his best
blue jacket and trowsers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner was the loft cleared of these unwelcome visitors,
than Harry and Peter began to recover from their
panic, and jumped out of the hay, shaking themselves free
from it, and skipping about in greater glee than ever.</p>

<p>While they played about, as they had done before, and
tumbled as if they had been tumblers at Ducrow&#8217;s, poor
Harry got into such spirits, that he completely forgot about
the deep holes called mangers, for containing the horse&#8217;s
food, till all at once, when Peter was running after him, he
fell, with a loud crash, headlong into one of them! Oh!
what a scream he gave!&mdash;it echoed through the stable, terrifying
a whole team of horses that were feeding there, more
particularly the one into whose manger he had fallen. The
horse gave a tremendous start when Harry plunged down
close to his nose, and not being able to run away, he put
back his ears, opened his mouth, and kicked and struggled
in the most frightful manner, while Harry, who could not
<a name="p0102.png" id="p0102.png" href="#p0102.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">102</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>make his escape any more than the horse, shouted louder
and louder for help.</p>

<p>Peter did all he could to assist Harry in this extraordinary
predicament, but finding it impossible to be of any use, he
forgot their terror of Mrs. Crabtree in his fears about Harry,
and rushed to the window, calling back their two pursuers,
who were walking away at a great distance. He screamed
and hollooed, and waved his handkerchief, without ceasing,
till at last Mrs. Crabtree heard him, and turned round, but
never was anybody more astonished then she was, on seeing
him there, so she scolded, stormed, and raged, up to the
very foot of the ladder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you are the besiegers, and I am the garrison!&rdquo;
cried Peter, when he saw Mrs. Crabtree panting and toiling
in her ascent. &ldquo;We must make a treaty of peace together,
for I could tumble you over in a minute, by merely
pushing this end a very little more to one side!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not touch it, Master Peter!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crabtree,
almost afraid he was in earnest. &ldquo;There is a good boy,&mdash;be
quiet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good boy!!&rdquo; whispered Peter to himself. &ldquo;What a
fright Mrs. Crabtree must be in, before she said that!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="nobot">The next moment Mrs. Crabtree snatched Harry out of
the manger, and shook him with rage. She then scolded
and beat him, till he was perfectly stupified with fright and
misery, after which the whole party were allowed to proceed
towards home, while Harry stumbled along the road, and
hung down his head, wishing, fifty times over, that he and
Peter Grey had never gone up</p>

pretended not to notice anything, though he stole a glance
to see what would happen next. On lifting up these mysterious
plates, what did they see lying underneath, but two
letters with large red seals, one directed to &ldquo;Master Harry
Graham,&rdquo; and the other to &ldquo;Miss Laura Graham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter for me!!&rdquo; cried Harry, in a tone of delighted
astonishment, while he tore open the seal, and his hand
shook with impatience, so that he could hardly unfold the
paper. &ldquo;What can it be about! I like getting a letter very
much! Is it from papa? Did the postman bring it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; said uncle David: &ldquo;and he left a message
that you must pay a hundred pounds for it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0104.png" id="p0104.png" href="#p0104.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">104</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Very likely, indeed,&rdquo; said Laura; &ldquo;you should pay that
for telling me such a fine story; but my letter is worth more
than a hundred pounds, for it is inviting me to spend another
delightful week at Holiday House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am asked too! and not Mrs. Crabtree!&rdquo; cried Harry,
looking at his letter, and almost screaming out for joy,
whilst he skipped about the room, rubbing his hands together,
and ended by twirling Laura round and round, till
they both fell prostrate on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that be meant as a specimen of how you intend to
behave at Holiday House, we had better send your apology
at once,&rdquo; observed Lady Harriet, smiling. &ldquo;Lord Rockville
is very particular about never hearing any noise, and
the slamming of a door, or even the creaking of a pair of
unruly shoes, would put him distracted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; added uncle David, &ldquo;Holiday House is as quiet
as Harry&#8217;s drum with a hole in it. If a pin drops in any
part of the mansion, Lord Rockville becomes annoyed, and
the very wasps scarcely dare to buz at his window so loud
as at any other person&#8217;s. You will feel quite fish-out-of-water-ish,
trying to be quiet and hum-drum for a whole
week, so let me advise you not to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The meaning of advice always is something that one
would rather wish not to do,&rdquo; observed Laura, gravely. &ldquo;I
never in my life was advised to enjoy anything pleasant!
Taking physic&mdash;or learning lessons&mdash;or staying at home,
are very often advised, but never playing&mdash;or having a holiday&mdash;or
amusing ourselves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Laura! that Harry&#8217;s little Shetland pony,
Tom Thumb, in my field, is of no use at present, but kicks,
and capers, and runs about all day; yet presently he will be
led out fastened to a rope, and made to trot round and round
in a circle, day after day, till he has no longer a will of his
own,&mdash;that is education. Afterwards he shall have a bridle
put in his mouth, which some little girls would be much the
<a name="p0105.png" id="p0105.png" href="#p0105.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">105</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>better of also, when he shall be carefully guided ever afterwards
in the best ways; and you likewise will go much more
steadily for all the reining-in and whipping you have got
from Mrs. Crabtree and me, which may, perhaps, make
you keep in the road of duty more easily hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David!&rdquo; said Harry, laughing, &ldquo;we have read
in the Arabian Nights, about people being turned into animals,
but I never thought you would turn Laura into a
horse! What shall we do with my little Shetland pony if I
go away next week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought of a capital plan for making Tom Thumb
useful during the whole winter! Your grandmama wants a
watch-dog in the country, so we shall build him a kennel&mdash;put
a chain round his neck, and get some one to teach
him to bark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David should be Professor of Nonsense at the
University,&rdquo; said Lady Harriet, smiling. &ldquo;But, my dear
children, if you are allowed to pay this visit at Holiday
House, I hope you will endeavour to behave creditably?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Major Graham, &ldquo;I understand that Lord
Rockville wished to have some particularly quiet children
there, for a short time, so he fixed upon Harry and Laura!
Poor, mistaken Lord Rockville! But, my good friends,
try not to break all his china ornaments the first day&mdash;spare
a few jars and tea-cups&mdash;leave a pane of glass or two in
the windows, and throw none of your marbles at the mirrors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember hearing,&rdquo; said Lady Harriet, &ldquo;that when
Miss Pelham was married last year, her old aunt, Mrs. Bouverie,
sent for her and said, that as she could not afford to
give baubles or trinkets, she would give her a very valuable
piece of advice; and what do you think it was, Laura?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no idea! Do tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall bestow it on you, as the old lady did on
<a name="p0106.png" id="p0106.png" href="#p0106.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">106</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>her niece&mdash;&lsquo;Be careful of china, paper and string, for they
are all very transitory possessions in this world!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true! and most judicious!&rdquo; observed Major Graham,
laughing. &ldquo;I certainly know several persons who
must have served an apprenticeship under that good lady.
Many gentlemen now, who despatch all their epistles from
the club, because there the paper costs them nothing, and a
number of ladies, who, for the same good reason, never
write letters till they are visiting in a country house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having received so many warnings and injunctions
about behaving well, Harry and Laura became so quiet
during the first few days at Holiday House, that they were
like shadows flitting through the rooms, going almost on
tiptoe, scarcely speaking above a whisper, and observing that
valuable rule for children, to let themselves be seen, but not
heard. Lord Rockville was quite charmed with such extreme
good conduct, for they were both in especial awe of
him, and thought it a great condescension if he even looked
at them, he was so tall, so grand, and so grave, wearing a
large powdered wig and silver spectacles, which gave him a
particularly venerable appearance, though Harry was one
day very near getting into disgrace upon that subject. His
Lordship had a habit of always carrying two pairs of spectacles
in his pocket, and often, after thrusting one pair
high on his forehead, he forgot where they were, and
put the others on his nose, which had such a droll appearance,
that the first time Harry saw it, he felt quite taken by surprise,
and burst into a fit of laughter, upon which Lord
Rockville gave him such a comical look of surprise and perplexity,
that Harry&#8217;s fit of laughing got worse and worse.
The more people know they are wrong, and try to stop, the
more convulsive it becomes, and the more difficult to look
grave again, so at last, after repeated efforts to appear serious
and composed, Harry started up, and in his hurry to
<a name="p0107.png" id="p0107.png" href="#p0107.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">107</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>escape, very nearly slammed the door behind him, which
would have given the last finish to his offences.</p>

<p>Both the little visitors found Lady Rockville so extremely
indulgent and kind, that she seemed like another grandmama,
therefore they gradually ventured to talk some of
their own nonsense before her, and even to try some of
their old ways, and frolicsome tricks, which she seldom
found any fault with, except when Harry one day eloped
with Lord Rockville&#8217;s favourite walking-stick, to be used as
a fishing-rod among the minnows, with a long thread at the
end for a line, and a crooked pin to represent the hook,
while, on the same day, Laura privately mounted the ass
that gave Lord Rockville&#8217;s ass&#8217;s milk, and rode it all round
the park, while he sat at home expecting his usual refreshing
tumbler. Still they both passed muster for being very tolerable
children, and his Lordship was heard once to say, in a
voice of great approbation, that Master and Miss Graham
were so punctual at dinner, and so perfectly quiet, he really
often forgot they were in the house. Indeed, Harry&#8217;s complaisance
on the day after he had laughed so injudiciously
about the spectacles, was quite unheard of, as he felt anxious
to make up for his misconduct; and when Lord Rockville
asked if he would like a fire in the play-room, as the
evening was chilly, he answered very politely, &ldquo;Thank
you, my Lord! We are ready to think it hot or cold, just
as you please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this was too good to last! One morning, when
Harry and Laura looked out of the window, it was a most
deplorably wet day. The whole sky looked like a large
grey cotton umbrella, and the clouds were so low that Harry
thought he could almost have touched them. In short, as
Lord Rockville remarked, &ldquo;it rained cats and dogs,&rdquo; so his
Lordship knitted his brows, and thrust his hands into his
waistcoat pockets, walking up and down the room in a perfect
fume of vexation, for he was so accustomed to be
<a name="p0108.png" id="p0108.png" href="#p0108.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">108</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>obeyed, that it seemed rather a hardship when even the
weather contradicted his wishes. To complete his vexation,
as &ldquo;single misfortunes never come alone,&rdquo; his valet,
when carelessly drying the Morning Post at a large kitchen
fire, had set it in flames, so that all the wonderful news it
contained became reduced to ashes, therefore Lord Rockville
might well have given notice, that, for this day at least,
he had a right to be in extremely bad humour.</p>

<p>Lady Rockville privately recommended Harry and Laura
to sit quietly down and play at cat&#8217;s cradle, which accordingly
they did, and when that became no longer endurable,
some dominos were produced. Thus the morning wore tediously
away till about two o&#8217;clock, when suddenly the rain
stopped, the sun burst forth with prodigious splendour, every
leaf in the park glittered, as if it had been sprinkled with
diamonds, and a hundred birds seemed singing a chorus of
joy, while bees and butterflies fluttered at the windows and
flew away rejoicing.</p>

<p>Harry was the first to observe this delightful change, and
with an exclamation of delight, he sprang from his seat,
pulled Laura from hers, upset the domino-table, and rushed
out of the room, slamming the door with a report like twenty
cannons. Away they both flew to the forest, Laura
swinging her bonnet in her hand, and Harry tossing his
cap in the air, while Lord Rockville watched them angrily
from the drawing-room window, saying, in a tone of extreme
displeasure, &ldquo;That boy has a voice that might do for
the town-crier! He laughs so loud, it is enough to crack
every glass in the room! I wish he were condemned to
pass a week in those American prisons where no one is
allowed to speak. In short, he would be better anywhere
than here, for I might as well live with a hammer and tongs,
as with the two children together. They are more restless
than the quicksilver figures from China, and I wish they
were as quiet, but my only comfort is, that at any rate they
<a name="p0109.png" id="p0109.png" href="#p0109.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">109</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>come home punctually to dinner at five. Nothing is so intolerable
as people dropping in too late and disordering the
table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meantime, the woods at Holiday House rung with sounds
of mirth and gaiety, while Harry scrambled up the trees like
a squirrel, and swung upon the branches, gathering walnuts
and crab-apples for Laura, after which they both cut their
names upon the bark of Lord Rockville&#8217;s favourite beech,
so that every person who passed that way must observe
the large distinct letters. They were laughing and chatting
over this exploit, both talking at once, as noisy and happy as
possible, and expecting nothing particular to happen, when,
all on a sudden, Laura turned pale, and grasped hold of
Harry&#8217;s arm, saying, in a low frightened voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Harry!&mdash;hush!&mdash;I hear a very strange noise.
It sounds like some wild beast! What can that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry listened as if he had ten pair of ears, and nearly
cracked his eye-balls staring round him, to see what could
be the matter. A curious deep growling sound might be
heard at some distance, while there was the noise of something
trampling heavily on the ground, and of branches
breaking off the trees, as if some large creature was forcing
his way through. Harry and Laura now stood like a couple
of little statues, not daring to breathe, they felt so terrified!
The noise grew louder and louder, while it gradually
came nearer and nearer, till at length a large black bull
burst into view, with his tail standing high in the air, while
he tore up the ground with his horns, bellowing as loudly
as he could roar, and galloping straight towards the place
where they stood.</p>

<p>Laura&#8217;s knees tottered under her, and she instantly dropped
on the ground with terror, feeling as if she would die
the next minute of fright, while, as for attempting to escape,
it never entered her head to think that possible. Harry
felt quite differently, for he was a bold boy, not easily
<a name="p0110.png" id="p0110.png" href="#p0110.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">110</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>scared out of his senses, and instantly saw that something
must be done, or they would both be lost. Many selfish
people would have run away alone, without caring for the
safety of any one but themselves, which was not at all the
case with Harry, who thought first of his poor frightened
companion. &ldquo;Hollo, Laura! are you hiding in a cart
rut?&rdquo; he exclaimed, pulling her hastily off the ground. &ldquo;The
bull will soon find you there! Come! come! as fast as
possible! we must have a race for it yet! That terrible
beast can scarcely make his way through the trees and
branches, they grow so closely! Perhaps we may get on
as fast as he!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time, Harry was dragging Laura along, and running
himself into the thickest part of the plantation; but it
was very difficult to make any progress, as she had become
quite faint and bewildered with fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Harry!&rdquo; cried she, trembling all over, &ldquo;you must
get on alone! I am so weak with terror, it is impossible to
run a step farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not waste your breath with talking,&rdquo; answered
Harry, still pushing on at full speed. &ldquo;How can you suppose
I would be so shabby as to make my escape without
you! No! no! we must either both be caught, or both
get off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura felt so grateful to Harry when he said this, that she
seemed for a moment almost to forget the bull, which was
still coming furiously on behind, while she now made a
desperate exertion to run faster than she had been able to
do before, clearing the ground almost as rapidly as Harry
could have done, though he still held her firmly by the hand,
to encourage her.</p>

<p>The trampling noise continued, the breaking of branches,
and the frightful bellowing of this dreadful animal, when at
last Harry caught sight of a wooden paling, which he silently
pointed out to Laura, being quite unable now to
<a name="p0111.png" id="p0111.png" href="#p0111.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">111</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>speak. Having rushed forward to it, with almost frantic
haste, Harry threw himself over the top, after which he
helped Laura to squeeze herself through underneath, when
they proceeded rather more leisurely onwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fence will puzzle Mr. Bull,&rdquo; said Harry triumphantly,
yet gasping for breath. &ldquo;We can push through
places where his great hoof could scarcely be thrust! I saw
him coming along, with his heels high in the air, and his
head down, like an enormous wheel-barrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scarcely had Harry spoken, before the infuriated animal
advanced at full gallop towards the fence, and after running
along the side a little way, he suddenly tore up the paling
with his horns, as if it had been made of paper, and rushed
forward more rapidly than ever.</p>

<p>Harry now began to fear that indeed all was over, for his
strength had become nearly exhausted, when, to his great
joy, he espied a large, rough stone wall, not very far off,
which was as welcome a sight as land to a shipwrecked
sailor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run for your life, Laura!&rdquo; he cried, pointing it out,
to encourage her. &ldquo;There is safety, if we reach it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On they both flew, faster than the wind, and Harry having
scrambled up the wall, like a grasshopper, pulled Laura
up beside him, and there they both stood at last, encamped
quite beyond the reach of danger, though the enemy arrived
a few minutes afterwards, pawing the air, and foaming and
bellowing with disappointment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura!&rdquo; said Harry, after she had a little recovered
from her fright, and was walking slowly homewards, while
she cast an alarmed glance frequently behind, thinking she
still heard the bull in pursuit, &ldquo;you see, as uncle David
says, whatever danger people are in, it is foolish to be quite
in despair, but we should rather think what it is best to do,
and do it directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Harry! and I shall never forget that you would
<a name="p0112.png" id="p0112.png" href="#p0112.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">112</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>not forsake me, but risked your own life, like a brave brother,
in my defence. I should like to do as much for you
another time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Laura, as much as if you had, but I hope
we shall never be in such a scrape again! If Frank were
here, he would put us both in mind to thank a merciful God
for taking so much care of us, and bringing us safely home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Harry! It is perhaps a good thing being in danger
sometimes, to remind us that we cannot be safe or happy
an hour without God&#8217;s care, so in our prayers to-night
we must remember what has happened, and return thanks
very particularly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was long past five before Harry and Laura reached
Holiday House, where Lord Rockville met them at the
drawing-room door, looking taller, and grander, and graver
than ever, while Lady Rockville rose from her sofa, and
came up to them, saying, in a tone of gentle reproach,</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear children! you ought to return home before
the dinner hour, and not keep his Lordship waiting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The very idea of Lord Rockville waiting dinner was too
dreadful ever to have entered their heads till this minute;
but Harry and Laura immediately explained how exceedingly
sorry they were for what had occurred, and to show that it
was their misfortune rather than their fault, they told the
whole frightful story of the mad bull, to which Lady Rockville
listened, as if her very hair were standing upon end, to
hear of such doings. She even turned up her eyes with astonishment
to think what a wonderful escape they had made;
but his Lordship frowned through his spectacles, and leaned
his chin upon his stick, looking, as Harry thought, very like
a bear upon a pole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&mdash;nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Rockville impatiently.
&ldquo;The bull would have done you no harm!
He is a most respectable, quiet, well-disposed animal, and
<a name="p0113.png" id="p0113.png" href="#p0113.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">113</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>brought an excellent character from his last place! I never
heard a complaint of him before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is curious,&rdquo; observed Laura, &ldquo;that all bulls are
reckoned peaceable and tame, till they have tossed two or
three people, and killed them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; added Lord Rockville, looking very grand
and contemptuous, &ldquo;that Harry was grown more a man
than to be so easily put to flight. When a bull, another
time, threatens to toss you, seize hold of his tail,&mdash;or toss
him!&mdash;or, in short, do anything rather than run away the
first time an animal looks at you. This is a mere cock-and-a-bull
story, to excuse your keeping me waiting almost
a quarter of an hour for my dinner!&mdash;you should be made
guard of a mail-coach for a month, to teach you punctuality,
Master Graham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Rockville gravely looked at his watch, while Harry
luckily considered how often his grandmama had recommended
him to make no answer when he was scolded, so he nearly
bit off the tip of his tongue to keep it quiet, while he could
not but wish, in his own mind, that my Lord himself saw
how very fierce the bull had looked.</p>

<p>Laura felt more vexed on Harry&#8217;s account than her own,
and the dinner went on as uncomfortably as possible; for even
when a French cook has dressed it, if ill-humour be the sauce,
any dish becomes unpalatable. Nothing was to be seen reflected
on the surface of many fine silver covers, but very
cross, or very melancholy faces; while Lady Rockville tried
to make her own countenance look both cheerful and good-natured.
She told Harry and Laura, to divert them, that
old Mrs. Bouverie had once been pursued by a furious milch
cow, along a lane, flanked on both sides by such very high
walls, that escape seemed impossible, so the good lady, who
was fat and breathless, became so desperate, that without a
hope of getting off, she seized the enraged animal by the
horns, and screamed in its face, till the cow herself became
<a name="p0114.png" id="p0114.png" href="#p0114.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">114</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>frightened. The creature stared, stepping backwards and
backwards, with increasing alarm, till at last, to the old
lady&#8217;s great relief and surprise, she fairly turned her tail and
ran off.</p>

<p>In the evening, Lord Rockville had not yet recovered his
equanimity, and went out, rather in bad humour, to take his
usual walk before supper. Without once remembering
about Harry and the bull, he strolled a great way into the
woods, marking several trees to be cut down, and admiring
a fine forest which he had planted himself long ago, but
without particularly considering what way he turned. It
was beginning, at last, to grow very dark and gloomy, so
Lord Rockville had some thoughts of returning home, when
he became suddenly startled by hearing a loud roar not far
off, and a moment afterwards the furious bull dashed out of
a neighbouring thicket, raging and foaming, and tearing
the ground with his horns, exactly as Harry had described
in the morning, while poor Lord Rockville, who seldom
moved faster than a very dignified walk, instantly quickened
his pace, in an opposite direction, striding away faster and
faster, till at last,&mdash;it must be confessed,&mdash;his Lordship ended
by running!!!</p>

<p>In spite of all Lord Rockville&#8217;s exertions, the bull continued
rapidly to gain upon him, for his Lordship, being
rather corpulent and easily fatigued, stopped every now and
then to gasp for breath; till at last, feeling it impossible to
get on faster, though the stables were now within sight, he
seized the branch of a large oak tree, which swept nearly to
the ground, and contrived, with great difficulty, to scramble
out of reach.</p>

<p>The enraged bull gazed up into the tree and bellowed with
fury, when he saw Lord Rockville so judiciously perched
overhead, and he remained for half-an-hour, watching to see
if his Lordship would venture down again. At last the tormenting
animal began leisurely eating grass under the tree,
<a name="p0115.png" id="p0115.png" href="#p0115.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">115</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>but gradually he moved away, turning his back while he fed,
till Lord Rockville vainly deluded himself with the hope of
stealing off unobserved. Being somewhat rested and refreshed,
while the enemy was looking in another direction,
he descended cautiously, as if he had been going to tread
upon needles and pins; but, unaccustomed to such movements,
he jumped so heavily upon the ground, that the bull
hearing a noise, turned round, and set up a loud furious
roar, when he saw his intended victim again within reach.</p>

<p>Now the race began once more with redoubled agility!
The odds seemed greatly in favour of the bull, and Lord
Rockville thought he already felt the animal&#8217;s horns in his
side, when a groom, who saw the party approaching, instantly
seized a pitchfork and flew to the rescue of his master.
Lord Rockville never stopped his career till he reached the
stable, and ran up into a loft, from the window of which he
gave the alarm and called for more assistance, when several
ploughmen and stable-boys assembled, who drove the animal
with great difficulty, into a stall, where he continued so
ungovernable, that iron chains were put round his neck,
and some days afterwards, seeing no one could manage
him, Lord Rockville ordered the bull to be shot, and his
carcase turned into beef for the poor of the parish, who all,
consequently, rejoiced at his demise; though the meat turned
out so tough, that it required their best teeth to eat it
with.</p>

<p>Meantime, on that memorable evening of so many adventures,
Harry, Laura, and Lady Rockville, wondered often
what had become of his Lordship, and, at last, when supper
appeared at the usual hour, his absence became still more
unaccountable!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can be the matter?&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Rockville,
anxiously. &ldquo;This is very odd! His Lordship is as punctual
as the postman in general! especially for supper; and
here is Lord Rockville&#8217;s favourite dish of sago and wine,
<a name="p0116.png" id="p0116.png" href="#p0116.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">116</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>which will become uneatably cold in ten minutes, if he does
not return home to enjoy it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scarcely had she finished speaking, when the door opened
and Lord Rockville walked majestically into the room.
There was something so different from usual in his manner
and appearance, however, that Harry and Laura exchanged
looks of astonishment; his neckcloth was loose&mdash;his face
excessively red&mdash;and his hand shook, while he breathed so
hard, that he might have been heard at the porter&#8217;s lodge.
Lady Rockville gazed with amazement at all she saw, and
then asked what he chose for supper; but when Lord Rockville
tried to speak, the words died on his lips, so he could
only point in silence to the sago and wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in all the world has happened to you this evening,
my Lord?&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Rockville, unable to restrain
her curiosity a moment longer. &ldquo;I never saw you in such
a way before! Your eyes are perfectly blood-shot&mdash;your
dress strangely disordered&mdash;and you seem so hot and so
fatigued! Tell me!&mdash;what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; answered Lord Rockville, drawing himself
up, while he tried to look grander and graver than ever,
though his Lordship could not help panting for breath&mdash;putting
his hands to his sides&mdash;and wiping his forehead with
his pocket-handkerchief in an agony of fatigue. Harry observed
all this for some time, as eagerly and intently as a
cat watches a bird on a tree. He saw that something extraordinary
had occurred, and he began to have hopes that
it really was the very thing he wished; because, seeing
Lord Rockville now perfectly safe, he would not have grudged
him a pretty considerable fright from his friend the bull.
At last, unable any longer to control his impatience, Harry
started off his chair, gazing so earnestly at Lord Rockville,
that his eyes almost sprung out of their sockets, while he
rubbed his hands with ecstacy, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&#8217;ve seen the bull? Oh! I am sure you did!

 class="pgmark">117</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Pray tell us if you have? Did he run after you,&mdash;and did
you run away?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="nobot">Lord Rockville tried more than he had ever done in his
life to look grave, but it would not do. Gradually his face
relaxed into a smile, till at last he burst into loud peals of
laughter, joined most heartily by Harry, Laura, and Lady
Rockville. Nobody recovered any gravity during the rest
of that evening, for whenever they tried to think or talk
quietly about anything else, Harry and Laura were sure to
burst forth again upon the subject, and even after being
safely stowed in their beds for the night, they both laughed
themselves to sleep at the idea of Lord Rockville himself
having been obliged, after all, to run away from that &ldquo;most
respectable, quiet, well-disposed animal,</p>

<p class="noindent top1">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Oh</span>! uncle David! uncle David!&rdquo; cried Laura, when
they arrived from Holiday House, &ldquo;I would jump out of
the carriage window with joy to see you again; only the
persons passing in the street might be surprised!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! They are quite accustomed to see people
jumping out of the windows with joy, whenever I appear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have so much to tell you,&rdquo; exclaimed Harry and
Laura, each seizing hold of a hand, &ldquo;we hardly know where
to begin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen! If you both talk at once, I must
get a new pair of ears! So you have not been particularly
miserable at Holiday House?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no! uncle David! we did not think there had been
so much happiness in the world,&rdquo; answered Laura, eagerly.
&ldquo;The last two days we could do nothing but play and laugh,
<span class="nw">and&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And grow fat! Why! you both look so well fed, you
are just fit for killing! I shall be obliged to shut you up two
or three days, without anything to eat, as is done to pet lap-dogs,
when they are getting corpulent and gouty.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0119.png" id="p0119.png" href="#p0119.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">119</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Then we shall be like bears living on our paws,&rdquo; replied
Harry, &ldquo;and uncle David! I would rather do that, than be
a glutton like Peter Grey. He went to a cheap shop lately,
where old cheese-cakes were sold at half-price, and greedily
devoured nearly a dozen, thinking that the dead flies scattered
on the top were currants, till Frank shewed him his
mistake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank should have let him eat in peace! There is no
accounting for tastes. I once knew a lady who liked to
swallow spiders! She used to crack and eat them with the
greatest delight, whenever she could catch one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! what a horrid woman! That is even worse than
grandmama&#8217;s story about Dr. Manvers having dined on a
dish of mice, fried in crumbs of bread!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the old proverb, Harry, &lsquo;one man&#8217;s meat is
another man&#8217;s poison.&rsquo; The Persians are disgusted at our
eating lobsters; and the Hindoos think us scarcely fit to
exist, because we live on beef; while we are equally amazed
at the Chinese for devouring dog pies, and birds&rsquo;-nest
soup. You turn up your nose at the French for liking
frogs; and they think us ten times worse with our singed
sheep&#8217;s head, oat cakes, and haggis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Lady Harriet, &ldquo;that when
Charles&nbsp;X. lived in what he called the &lsquo;dear Canongate,&rsquo;
His Majesty was heard to say, that he tried every sort of
Scotch goose, &lsquo;the solan goose, the wild goose, and the
tame goose; but the best goose of all, was the hag-goose.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very polite, indeed, to adopt our national taste so completely,&rdquo;
observed uncle David, smiling. &ldquo;When my regiment
was quartered in Spain, an officer of ours, a great epicure,
and not quite so complaisant, used to say that the
country was scarcely fit to live in, because there it is customary
to dress almost every dish with sugar. At last, one
day, in a rage, he ordered eggs to be brought up in their
shells for dinner, saying, &lsquo;that is the only thing the cook
<a name="p0120.png" id="p0120.png" href="#p0120.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">120</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>cannot possibly spoil.&rsquo; We played him a trick, however,
which was very like what you would have done, Harry, on a
similar occasion. I secretly put pounded sugar into the
salt-cellar, and when he tasted his first mouthful, you should
have seen the look of fury with which he sprung off his seat,
exclaiming, &lsquo;the barbarians eat sugar even with their eggs!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be the country for me to travel in,&rdquo; said
Harry. &ldquo;I could live in a barrel of sugar; and my little
pony, Tom Thumb, would be happy to accompany me
there, as he likes anything sweet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All animals are of the same opinion. I remember the
famous rider, Ducrow, telling a brother-officer of mine, that
the way in which he gains so much influence over his
horses, is merely by bribing them with sugar. They may be
managed in that way like children, and are quite aware, if
it be taken from them as a punishment for being restive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! those beautiful horses at Ducrow&#8217;s! How often I
think of them since we were there!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry.
&ldquo;They were quite like fairies, with fine arched necks, and
long tails!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard before of a fairy with a long tail, Master
Harry; but perhaps in the course of your travels you may
have seen such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I should like to ride upon Tom Thumb, in Ducrow&#8217;s
way, with my toe on the saddle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine doings indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Crabtree, who
had entered the room at this moment. &ldquo;Have you forgotten
already, Master Harry, how many of the nursery<!-- original reads "nursey" --> plates
you broke one day when I was out, in trying to copy that
there foolish Indian juggler, who tossed his plates in the air,
and twirled them on his thumb! There must be no more
such nonsense; for if once your neck is broke by a fall off
Tom Thumb, no doctor that I know of can mend it again.
Remember what a terrible tumble you had off Jessy last
year!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0121.png" id="p0121.png" href="#p0121.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">121</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;You are always speaking about that little overturn, Mrs.
Crabtree; and it was not worth recollecting above a week!
Did you never see a man thrown off his horse before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man and horse indeed!&rdquo; said uncle David, laughing,
when he looked at Harry. &ldquo;You and your charger were
hardly large enough then for a toy-shop; and you must
grow a little more, Captain Gulliver, before you will be fit
for a dragoon regiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura stayed very quietly at home for several
weeks after their return from Holiday House, attending so
busily to lessons, that uncle David said he felt much afraid
they were going to be a pair of little wonders, who would
die of too much learning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be taken ill of the multiplication table some
day, and confined to bed with a violent fit of geography!
Pray take care of yourselves, and do not devour above three
books at once,&rdquo; said Major Graham one day, entering the
room with a note in his hand. &ldquo;Here is an invitation
that I suppose you are both too busy to accept, so perhaps I
might as well send an apology; eh, Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down dropped the lesson-books upon the floor, and up
sprung Harry in an ecstacy of delight. &ldquo;An invitation!
Oh! I like an invitation so very much! Pray tell us all
about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is an invitation to spend a month with Dr.
Lexicon. What would you say to that? They breakfast
upon Latin grammars at school, and have a dish of real
French verbs, smothered in onions, for dinner every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in downright earnest, uncle David! where are we
going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must I tell you? Well! that good-natured old lady,
Mrs. Darwin, intends taking a large party of children next
week, in her own carriage, to pass ten days at Ivy Lodge, a
charming country house about twenty miles off, where you
are all to enjoy perfect happiness. I wish I could be ground
<a name="p0122.png" id="p0122.png" href="#p0122.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">122</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>down into a little boy myself, for the occasion! Poor good
woman! what a life she will lead! There is only one little
drawback to your delight, that I am almost afraid to announce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that, uncle David?&rdquo; asked Harry, looking as if
nothing in nature could ever make him grave again.
&ldquo;Are we to bite off our own noses before we return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly; but somebody is to be of the party who
will do it for you. Mrs. Darwin has heard that there are
certain children who become occasionally rather unmanageable!
I cannot think who they can be, for it is certainly
nobody we ever saw; so she has requested that Mrs. Crabtree
will follow in the mail-coach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura looked as if a glass of cold water had
been thrown in their faces, after this was mentioned; but
they soon forgot every little vexation, in a burst of joy, when,
some days afterwards, Mrs. Darwin stopped at the door to
pick them up, in the most curious-looking carriage they had
ever seen. It was a very large open car, as round as a
bird&#8217;s nest, and so perfectly crowded with children, that nobody
could have supposed any room left even for a doll;
but Mrs. Darwin said that whatever number of people came
in, there was always accommodation for one more; and
this really proved to be the case, for Harry and Laura soon
elbowed their way into seats and set off, waving their handkerchiefs
to Major Graham, who had helped to pack them
in, and who now stood smiling at the door.</p>

<p>As this very large vehicle was drawn by only one horse,
it proceeded very slowly; but Mrs. Darwin amused the
children with several very diverting stories, and gave them
a grand luncheon in the carriage; after which, they threw
what was left, wrapped up in an old newspaper, to some people
breaking stones on the road, feeling quite delighted to
see the surprise and joy of the poor labourers when they
opened the parcel. In short, everybody became sorry when
<a name="p0123.png" id="p0123.png" href="#p0123.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">123</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>this diverting journey was finished, and they drove up, at
last, to the gate of a tall old house, that looked as if it had
been built in the year one. The walls were very thick, and
quite mouldy with age. Indeed, the only wonder was, that
Ivy Lodge had still a roof upon its head, for every thing
about it looked so tottering and decayed. The very servants
were all old; and a white-headed butler opened the
door, who looked as frail and gloomy as the house; but
before long, the old walls of Ivy Lodge rung and echoed
again with sounds of mirth and joy. It seemed to have
been built on purpose for hide and seek; there were rooms
with invisible doors, and closets cut in the walls, and great
old chests where people might have been buried alive for a
year, without being found out. The gardens, too, were
perfectly enchanting. Such arbours to take strawberries
and cream in! and such summer-houses, where they drank
tea out of doors every evening! Here they saw a prodigious
eagle, fastened to the ground by a chain, and looking
the most dull, melancholy creature in the world; while
Harry wished the poor bird might be liberated, and thought
how delightful it would be to stand by and see him soaring
away to his native skies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! with a large slice of raw meat in his beak!&rdquo; said
Peter Grey, who was always thinking of eating. &ldquo;I dare
say he lives much better here, than he would do killing his
own mutton up in the clouds there, or taking his chance of
a dead horse on the sea-shore occasionally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Peter were particularly amused with Mrs.
Darwin&#8217;s curious collection of pets. There were black
swans with red bills, swimming gracefully in a pond close to
the window, and ready to rush forward on the shortest notice,
for a morsel of bread. The lop-eared rabbits also surprised
them, with their ears hanging down to the ground, and they
were interested to see a pair of carrier-pigeons which could
carry letters as well as the postman. Mrs. Darwin showed
<a name="p0124.png" id="p0124.png" href="#p0124.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">124</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>them tumbler pigeons too, that performed a summerset in
the air when they flew, and horsemen and dragoon pigeons,
trumpeters and pouters, till Peter Grey at last begged to see
the pigeons that made the pigeon-pies, and the cow that gave
the butter-milk; he was likewise very anxious for leave to
bring his fishing-rod into the drawing-room, to try whether
he could catch one of the beautiful gold-fish that swam
about in a large glass globe, saying he thought it might
perhaps be very good to eat at breakfast. Mrs. Darwin
had a pet lamb that she was exceedingly fond of, because it
followed her everywhere, and Harry, who was very fond of
the little creature, said he wished some plan could be invented
to hinder its ever growing into a great fat vulgar
sheep; and he thought the white mice were old animals that
had grown grey with years.</p>

<p>There were donkies for the children to ride upon, and
Mrs. Darwin had a boat that held the whole party, to sail in,
round the pond, and she hung up a swing that seemed to fly
about as high as the house, which they swung upon, after
which they were allowed to shake the fruit-trees, and to eat
whatever came down about their ears; so it very often rained
apples and pears in the gardens at Ivy Lodge, for Peter
seemed never to tire of that joke; indeed the apple-trees
had a sad life of it as long as he remained.</p>

<p>Peter told Mrs. Darwin that he had &ldquo;a patent appetite,&rdquo;
which was always ready on every occasion; but the good
lady became so fond of stuffing the children at all hours,
that even he felt a little puzzled sometimes how to dispose
of all she heaped upon his plate, while both Harry and Laura,
who were far from greedy, became perfectly wearied of
hearing the gong. The whole party assembled at eight
every morning, to partake of porridge and butter-milk, after
which, at ten, they breakfasted with Mrs. Darwin on tea,
muffins, and sweetmeats. They then drove in the round
open car, to bathe in the sea, on their return from which,
<a name="p0125.png" id="p0125.png" href="#p0125.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">125</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>luncheon was always ready, and after concluding that, they
might pass the interval till dinner among the fruit-trees.
They never could eat enough to please Mrs. Darwin at dinner;
tea followed, on a most substantial plan; their supper
consisted of poached eggs, and the maid was desired to put
a biscuit under every visitor&#8217;s pillow, in case the young
people should be hungry in the night, for Mrs. Darwin said
she had been starved at school herself, when she was a little
girl, and wished nobody ever to suffer, as she had done,
from hunger.</p>

<p>The good lady was so anxious for everything to be exactly
as the children liked it, that sometimes Laura felt quite
at a loss what to say or do. One day, having cracked her
egg-shell at breakfast, Mrs. Darwin peeped anxiously over
her shoulder, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, my dear! your egg is all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most excellent indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it quite fresh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly! I dare say it was laid only a minute before
it was boiled!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen the eggs much larger than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! but then I believe they are rather coarse,&mdash;at least
we think so, when Mrs. Crabtree gives us a turkey egg at
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you prefer them small, perhaps you would like a guinea-fowl&#8217;s
egg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you! but this one is just as I like them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks rather over-done! If you think so, we could
get another in a minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! they are better well boiled!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then probably it is not enough done. Some people
like them quite hard, and I could easily pop it into the slop-basin
for another minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am really obliged to you, but it could not be improved.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0126.png" id="p0126.png" href="#p0126.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">126</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Do you not take any more salt with your egg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few more grains would improve it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say so, I dare say they will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! now I am afraid you have put in too much! pray
do get another!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This long-continued attack upon her egg was too much
for Laura&#8217;s gravity, who appeared for some minutes to have
a violent fit of coughing, and ending in a burst of laughter,
after which she hastily finished all that remained of it, and
thus ended the discussion.</p>

<p>In the midst of all their happiness, while the children
thought that every succeeding day had no fault but being
too short, and Harry even planned with Peter to stop the
clock altogether, and see whether time itself would not stand
still, nobody ever thought for a moment of anything but
joy; and yet a very sad and sudden distress awaited Mrs.
Darwin. One forenoon she received a letter that seemed
very hastily and awkwardly folded,&mdash;the seal was all to one
side, and surrounded with stray drops of red wax,&mdash;the direction
appeared sadly blotted, and at the top was written in
large letters, the words, &ldquo;To be delivered immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Mrs. Darwin hurriedly tore open this very strange-looking
letter, she found that it came from her own housekeeper
in town, to announce the dreadful event that her sister,
Lady Barnet, had been that day seized with an apoplectic
fit, and was thought to be at the point of death, therefore it
was hoped that Mrs. Darwin would not lose an hour in returning
to town, that she might be present on the melancholy
occasion. The shock of hearing this news was so
very great, that poor Mrs. Darwin could not speak about it,
but after trying to compose herself for a few minutes, she
went into the play-room, and told the children that, for reasons
she could not explain, they must get ready to return
<a name="p0127.png" id="p0127.png" href="#p0127.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">127</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>home in an hour, when the car would be at the door for
their journey.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed their surprise on hearing Mrs.
Darwin make such an unexpected proposal. At first Peter
Grey thought she was speaking in jest, and said he would
prefer if she ordered out a balloon to travel in, this morning;
but when it appeared that Mrs. Darwin was really in
earnest about their pleasant visit being over so soon, Harry&#8217;s
face grew perfectly red with passion, while he said in a
loud angry voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmama allowed me to stay here till Friday!&mdash;and
I was invited to stay,&mdash;and I will not go anywhere else!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh fie, Master Harry!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crabtree. &ldquo;Do not
talk so! You ought to know better! I shall soon teach
you, however, to do as you are bid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying these words, she stretched out her hand to seize
violent hold of him, but Harry dipped down and escaped.
Quickly opening the door, he ran, half in joke and half in
earnest, at full speed up two pairs of stairs, followed closely
by Mrs. Crabtree, who was now in a terrible rage, especially
when she saw what a piece of fun Harry thought this fatiguing
race. A door happened to be standing wide open
on the second landing-place, which, having been observed
by Harry, he darted in, and slammed it in Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s
face, locking and double-locking it, to secure his own safety,
after which he sat down in this empty apartment to enjoy
his victory in peace. When people once begin to
grow self-willed and rebellious, it is impossible to guess
where it will all end! Harry might have been easily led to
do right at first, if any one had reasoned with him and
spoken kindly, but now he really was in a sort of don&#8217;t-care-a-button
humour, and scarcely minded what he did next.</p>

<p>As long as Mrs. Crabtree continued to scold and rave
behind the door, Harry grew harder and harder; but at
length the good old lady, Mrs. Darwin herself, arrived up
<a name="p0128.png" id="p0128.png" href="#p0128.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">128</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>stairs, and represented how ungrateful he was, not doing all
in his power to please her, when she had taken so much
pains to make him happy. This brought the little rebel
round in a moment, as he became quite sensible of his own
misconduct, and resolved immediately to submit. Accordingly,
Harry tried to open the door, but, what is very easily
done cannot sometimes be undone, which turned out the
case on this occasion, as, with all his exertions, the key
would not turn in the lock! Harry tried it first one way,
then another. He twisted with his whole strength, till his
face became perfectly scarlet with the effort, but in vain!
At last he put the poker through the handle of the key,
thinking this a very clever plan, and quite sure to succeed,
but after a desperate struggle, the unfortunate key broke in
two, so then nobody could possibly open the door!</p>

<p>After this provoking accident happened, Harry felt what
a very bad boy he had been, so he burst into tears, and
called through the key-hole to beg Mrs. Darwin&#8217;s pardon,
while Mrs. Crabtree scolded him through the key-hole in
return, till Harry shrunk away as if a cannonading had begun
at his ear.</p>

<p>Meantime, Mrs. Darwin hurried off, racking her brains
to think what had best be done to deliver the prisoner, since
no time could be lost, or she might perhaps not get to town
at all that night, and the car was expected every minute, to
come round for the travellers. The gardener said he
thought it might be possible to find a few ladders, which,
being tied one above another, would perhaps reach as high
as the window, where Harry had now appeared, and by
which he could easily scramble down; so the servants made
haste to fetch all they could find, and to borrow all they
could see, till a great many were collected. These they
joined together very strongly with ropes, but when it was at
last reared against the wall, to the great disappointment of
<a name="p0129.png" id="p0129.png" href="#p0129.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">129</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Mrs. Darwin, the ladder appeared a yard and a-half too
short!</p>

<p>What was to be done?</p>

<p>The obliging gardener mounted to the very top of his
ladder, and Harry leaned so far over the window, he seemed
in danger of falling out, but still they did not reach one
another, so not a single person could guess what plan was
to be tried next. At length Harry called out very loudly to
the gardener,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hollo! Mr. King of Spades! If I were to let myself
drop very gently down from the window, could you catch
me in your arms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harry! Mr. Harry! if you dare!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Crabtree, shaking her fist at him. &ldquo;You&#8217;ll be broken in
pieces like a tea-pot, you&#8217;ll be made as flat as a pancake!
Stay where you are! Do ye hear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Harry seemed suddenly grown deaf, and was now
more than half out&mdash;fixing his fingers very firmly on the
ledge of the window, and slowly dropping his legs downwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Harry! you will be killed!&rdquo; screamed Laura.
&ldquo;Stop! stop! Harry, are you mad? can nobody stop
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But nobody could stop him, for, being so high above
everybody&#8217;s head, Harry had it all his own way, and was
now nearly hanging altogether out of the window, but he
stopped a single minute, and called out, &ldquo;Do not be frightened,
Laura! I have behaved very ill, and deserve the
worst that can happen. If I do break my head, it will save
Mrs. Crabtree the trouble of breaking it for me, after I
come down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gardener now balanced himself steadily on the upper
step of the ladder, and spread his arms out, while Harry
slowly let himself drop. Laura tried to look on without
screaming out, as that might have startled him, but the
<a name="p0130.png" id="p0130.png" href="#p0130.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">130</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>scene became too frightful, so she closed her eyes, put her
hands over her face and turned away, while her heart beat so
violently, that it might almost have been heard. Even
Mrs. Crabtree clasped her hands in an agony of alarm,
while Mrs. Darwin put up her pocket handkerchief, and
could not look on another moment. An awful pause took
place, during which, a feather falling on the ground would
have startled them, when suddenly a loud shout from Peter
Grey and the other children, which was gaily echoed from
the top of the ladder, made Laura venture to look up, and
there was Harry safe in the gardener&#8217;s arms, who soon helped
him down to the ground, where he immediately asked pardon
of everybody for the fright he had given them.</p>

<p>There was no time for more than half a scold from Mrs.
Crabtree, as Mrs. Darwin&#8217;s car had been waiting some
time; so Harry said she might be owing him the rest, on
some future occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! and a hundred lashes besides!&rdquo; added Peter
Grey, laughing. &ldquo;Pray touch him up well, Mrs. Crabtree,
when you are about it. There is no law against cruelty to
boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This put Mrs. Crabtree into such a rage, that she followed
Peter with a perfect hail-storm of angry words, till at
last, for a joke, he put up Mrs. Darwin&#8217;s umbrella to screen
himself, and immediately afterwards the car drove slowly
off.</p>

<p>When uncle David heard all the adventures at Ivy Lodge,
he listened most attentively to &ldquo;the confessions of Master
Harry Graham,&rdquo; and shook his head in a most serious
manner after they were concluded, saying, &ldquo;I have always
thought that boys are like cats, with nine lives at least!
You should be hung up in a basket, Harry, as they do with
unruly boys in the South Sea Islands, where such young
gentlemen as you are left dangling in the air for days together
without a possibility of escape!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0131.png" id="p0131.png" href="#p0131.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">131</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;I would not care for that compared with being teazed
and worried by Mrs. Crabtree. I really wish, uncle David,
that Dr. Bell would order me never to be scolded any more!
It is very bad for me! I generally feel an odd sort of over-all-ish-ness
as soon as she begins; and I am getting too
big now, for any thing but a birch-rod like Frank. How
pleasant it is to be a grown-up man, uncle David, as you
are, sitting all day at the club with your hat on your head,
and nothing to do but look out of the window. That is what
I call happiness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But once upon a time, Harry,&rdquo; said Lady Harriet,
&ldquo;when I stopped in the carriage for your uncle David at
the club, he was in the middle of such a yawn at the window,
that he very nearly dislocated his jaw! it was quite
alarming to see him, and he told me in a great secret, that
the longest and most tiresome hours of his life are, when
he has nothing particular to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, at this moment, I have nothing particular to do,&rdquo;
said Major Graham, &ldquo;therefore I shall tell you a wonderful
story, children, about liking to be idle or busy, and you
must find out the moral for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;A story! a story!&rdquo; cried Harry and Laura, in an ecstacy
of delight, and as they each had a knee of uncle David&#8217;s,
which belonged to themselves, they scrambled into
their places, exclaiming, &ldquo;Now let it be all about very bad
boys, and giants, and fairies!&rdquo;</p>

<div>&ldquo;Pie-crust and pastry-crust, that was the wall;</div>
<div>The windows were made of black-puddings and white,</div>
<div>And slated with pancakes&mdash;you ne&#8217;er saw the like!&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">In</span> the days of yore, children were not all such clever, good
sensible people as they are now! Lessons were then considered
rather a plague, sugar-plums were still in demand&mdash;holidays
continued yet in fashion&mdash;and toys were not then
made to teach mathematics, nor story-books to give instruction
in chemistry and navigation. These were very strange
times, and there existed at that period, a very idle, greedy,
naughty boy, such as we never hear of in the present day. His
papa and mama were&mdash;&mdash;no matter who,&mdash;&mdash;and he lived,
no matter where. His name was Master No-book, and he
seemed to think his eyes were made for nothing but to stare
out of the windows, and his mouth for no other purpose but
to eat. This young gentleman hated lessons like mustard,
both of which brought tears into his eyes, and during school-hours,
he sat gazing at his books, pretending to be busy,
while his mind wandered away to wish impatiently for his
dinner, and to consider where he could get the nicest pies,
pastry, ices, and jellies, while he smacked his lips at the
<a name="p0133.png" id="p0133.png" href="#p0133.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">133</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>very thoughts of them. I think he must have been first
cousin to Peter Grey, but that is not perfectly certain.</p>

<p>Whenever Master No-book spoke, it was always to ask
for something, and you might continually hear him say, in
a whining tone of voice, &ldquo;Papa! may I take this piece of
cake? Aunt Sarah! will you give me an apple? Mama! do
send me the whole of that plum-pudding!&rdquo; Indeed, very
frequently when he did not get permission to gormandize,
this naughty glutton helped himself without leave. Even
his dreams were like his waking hours, for he had often a
horrible night-mare about lessons, thinking that he was smothered
with Greek Lexicons, or pelted out of the school with
a shower of English Grammars, while one night, he fancied
himself sitting down to devour an enormous plum-cake, and
that all on a sudden it became transformed into a Latin
Dictionary!</p>

<p>One afternoon, Master No-book, having played truant all
day from school, was lolling on his mama&#8217;s best sofa in the
drawing-room, with his leather boots tucked up on the satin
cushions, and nothing to do but to suck a few oranges, and
nothing to think of but how much sugar to put upon them,
when suddenly an event took place which filled him with
astonishment.</p>

<p>A sound of soft music stole into the room, becoming
louder and louder the longer he listened, till at length, in a
few moments afterwards, a large hole burst open in the wall
of his room, and there stepped into his presence, two magnificent
fairies, just arrived from their castle in the air, to
pay him a visit. They had travelled all the way on purpose
to have some conversation with Master No-book, and immediately
introduced themselves in a very ceremonious manner.</p>

<p>The fairy Do-nothing was gorgeously dressed with a
wreath of flaming gas round her head, a robe of gold tissue,
a necklace of rubies, and a bouquet in her hand, of glittering
<a name="p0134.png" id="p0134.png" href="#p0134.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">134</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>diamonds. Her cheeks were rouged to the very eyes,&mdash;her
teeth were set in gold, and her hair was of a most
brilliant purple; in short, so fine and fashionable looking a
fairy never was seen in a drawing-room before.</p>

<p>The fairy Teach-all, who followed next, was simply dressed
in white muslin, with bunches of natural flowers in her
light brown hair, and she carried in her hand a few neat
small books, which Master No-book looked at with a shudder
of aversion.</p>

<p>The two fairies now informed him, that they very often
invited large parties of children, to spend some time at their
palaces, but as they lived in quite an opposite direction, it
was necessary for their young guests to choose which it
would be best to visit first; therefore now they had come to
inquire of Master No-book, whom he thought it would be
most agreeable to accompany on the present occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my house,&rdquo; said the fairy Teach-all, speaking with a
very sweet smile, and a soft, pleasing voice, &ldquo;you shall be
taught to find pleasure in every sort of exertion, for I delight
in activity and diligence. My young friends rise at seven
every morning, and amuse themselves with working in a
beautiful garden of flowers,&mdash;rearing whatever fruit they
wish to eat,&mdash;visiting among the poor,&mdash;associating pleasantly
together,&mdash;studying the arts and sciences,&mdash;and learning
to know the world in which they live, and to fulfil the
purposes for which they have been brought into it. In short,
all our amusements tend to some useful object, either for our
own improvement or the good of others, and you will grow
wiser, better, and happier every day you remain in the Palace
of Knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in Castle Needless where I live,&rdquo; interrupted the
fairy Do-nothing, rudely pushing her companion aside, with
an angry contemptuous look, &ldquo;we never think of exerting
ourselves for anything. You may put your head in your
pocket, and your hands in your sides as long as you choose
<a name="p0135.png" id="p0135.png" href="#p0135.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">135</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>to stay. No one is ever even asked a question, that he
may be spared the trouble of answering. We lead the most
fashionable life that can be imagined, for nobody speaks to
anybody! Each of my visitors is quite an exclusive, and sits
with his back to as many of the company as possible, in the
most comfortable arm-chair that can be imagined. There,
if you are only so good as to take the trouble of wishing for
anything, it is yours, without even turning an eye round
to look where it comes from. Dresses are provided of the
most magnificent kind, which go on of themselves, without
your having the smallest annoyance with either buttons or
strings,&mdash;games which you can play without an effort of
thought,&mdash;and dishes dressed by a French cook, smoking
hot and hot under your nose, from morning till night,&mdash;while
any rain we have, is either made of cherry brandy,
lemonade, or lavender water,&mdash;and in winter it generally
snows iced-punch for an hour during the forenoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody need be told which fairy Master No-book preferred;
and quite charmed at his own good fortune in receiving
so agreeable an invitation, he eagerly gave his
hand to the splendid new acquaintance, who promised him
so much pleasure and ease, and gladly proceeded, in a carriage
lined with velvet, stuffed with downy pillows, and
drawn by milk-white swans, to that magnificent residence
Castle Needless, which was lighted by a thousand windows
during the day, and by a million of lamps every night.</p>

<p>Here Master No-book enjoyed a constant holiday and a
constant feast, while a beautiful lady, covered with jewels,
was ready to tell him stories from morning till night, and
servants waited to pick up his playthings if they fell, or to
draw out his purse or his pocket-handkerchief when he wished
to use them.</p>

<p>Thus Master No-book lay dozing for hours and days on
rich embroidered cushions, never stirring from his place,
but admiring the view of trees covered with the richest
<a name="p0136.png" id="p0136.png" href="#p0136.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">136</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>burned almonds, grottoes of sugar-candy, a jet d&#8217;eau of
champagne, a wide sea which tasted of sugar instead of salt,
and a bright clear pond, filled with gold-fish, that let themselves
be caught whenever he pleased. Nothing could be
more complete, and yet, very strange to say, Master No-book
did not seem particularly happy! This appears exceedingly
unreasonable, when so much trouble was taken to
please him; but the truth is, that every day he became more
fretful and peevish. No sweetmeats were worth the trouble
of eating, nothing was pleasant to play at, and in the end
he wished it were possible to sleep all day, as well as all
night.</p>

<p>Not a hundred miles from the fairy Do-nothing&#8217;s palace,
there lived a most cruel monster called the giant Snap-&#8217;em-up,
who looked, when he stood up, like the tall steeple of a
great church, raising his head so high, that he could peep
over the loftiest mountains, and was obliged to climb up a
ladder to comb his own hair.</p>

<p>Every morning regularly, this prodigiously great giant
walked round the world before breakfast for an appetite, after
which, he made tea in a large lake, used the sea as a slop-basin,
and boiled his kettle on Mount Vesuvius. He lived
in great style, and his dinners were most magnificent, consisting
very often of an elephant roasted whole, ostrich patties,
a tiger smothered in onions, stewed lions, and whale
soup; but for a side-dish his greatest favourite consisted of
little boys, as fat as possible, fried in crumbs of bread, with
plenty of pepper and salt.</p>

<p>No children were so well fed, or in such good condition
for eating, as those in the fairy Do-nothing&#8217;s garden, who
was a very particular friend of the great Snap-&#8217;em-up&#8217;s, and
who sometimes laughingly said she would give him a license,
and call her own garden his &ldquo;preserve,&rdquo; because she
allowed him to help himself, whenever he pleased, to as
many of her visitors as he chose, without taking the
<a name="p0137.png" id="p0137.png" href="#p0137.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">137</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>trouble even to count them, and in return for such extreme
civility, the giant very frequently invited her to dinner.</p>

<p>Snap-&#8217;em-up&#8217;s favourite sport was, to see how many brace
of little boys he could bag in a morning; so in passing
along the streets, he peeped into all the drawing-rooms
without having occasion to get upon tiptoe, and picked up
every young gentleman who was idly looking out of the
windows, and even a few occasionally who were playing
truant from school, but busy children seemed always somehow
quite out of his reach.</p>

<p>One day, when Master No-book felt even more lazy,
more idle, and more miserable than ever, he lay beside a
perfect mountain of toys and cakes, wondering what to wish
for next, and hating the very sight of everything and everybody.
At last he gave so loud a yawn of weariness and
disgust, that his jaw very nearly fell out of joint, and then
he sighed so deeply, that the giant Snap-&#8217;em-up heard the
sound as he passed along the road after breakfast, and instantly
stepped into the garden, with his glass at his eye, to
see what was the matter. Immediately on observing a large,
fat, over-grown boy, as round as a dumpling, lying on a bed
of roses, he gave a cry of delight, followed by a gigantic peal
of laughter, which was heard three miles off, and picking up
Master No-book between his finger and his thumb, with a
pinch that very nearly broke his ribs, he carried him rapidly
towards his own castle, while the fairy Do-nothing laughingly
shook her head as he passed, saying, &ldquo;That little man
does me great credit!&mdash;he has only been fed for a week,
and is as fat already as a prize ox! What a dainty morsel
he will be! When do you dine to-day, in case I should
have time to look in upon you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On reaching home, the giant immediately hung up Master
No-book by the hair of his head, on a prodigious hook
in the larder, having first taken some large lumps of nasty
suet, forcing them down his throat to make him become
<a name="p0138.png" id="p0138.png" href="#p0138.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">138</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>still fatter, and then stirring the fire, that he might be almost
melted with heat, to make his liver grow larger. On a
shelf quite near, Master No-book perceived the dead bodies
of six other boys, whom he remembered to have seen fattening
in the fairy Do-nothing&#8217;s garden, while he recollected
how some of them had rejoiced at the thoughts of
leading a long, useless, idle life, with no one to please but
themselves.</p>

<p>The enormous cook now seized hold of Master No-book,
brandishing her knife, with an aspect of horrible determination,
intending to kill him, while he took the trouble of
screaming and kicking in the most desperate manner, when
the giant turned gravely round and said, that as pigs were
considered a much greater dainty when whipped to death
than killed in any other way, he meant to see whether children
might not be improved by it also; therefore she might
leave that great hog of a boy till he had time to try the experiment,
especially as his own appetite would be improved
by the exercise. This was a dreadful prospect for the unhappy
prisoner; but meantime it prolonged his life a few
hours, as he was immediately hung up again in the larder,
and left to himself. There, in torture of mind and body,&mdash;like
a fish upon a hook,&mdash;the wretched boy began at last to
reflect seriously upon his former ways, and to consider
what a happy home he might have had, if he could only
have been satisfied with business and pleasure succeeding
each other, like day and night, while lessons might have
come in, as a pleasant sauce to his play-hours, and his play-hours
as a sauce to his lessons.</p>

<p>In the midst of many reflections, which were all very
sensible, though rather too late. Master No-book&#8217;s attention
became attracted by the sound of many voices laughing,
talking, and singing, which caused him to turn his eyes in
a new direction, when, for the first time, he observed that
the<!-- "t" invisible in original --> fairy Teach-all&#8217;s garden lay upon a beautiful sloping
<a name="p0139.png" id="p0139.png" href="#p0139.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">139</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>bank not far off. There a crowd of merry, noisy, rosy-cheeked
boys, were busily employed, and seemed happier
than the day was long; while poor Master No-book watched
them during his own miserable hours, envying the enjoyment
with which they raked the flower-borders, gathered
the fruit, carried baskets of vegetables to the poor, worked
with carpenters&#8217; tools, drew pictures, shot with bows and
arrows, played at cricket, and then sat in the sunny arbours
learning their tasks, or talking agreeably together, till at
length, a dinner-bell having been rung, the whole party
sat merrily down with hearty appetites, and cheerful good-humour,
to an entertainment of plain roast meat and pudding,
where the fairy Teach-all presided herself, and helped
her guests moderately, to as much as was good for each.</p>

<p>Large tears rolled down the cheeks of Master No-book
while watching this scene; and remembering that if he
had known what was best for him, he might have been as
happy as the happiest of these excellent boys, instead of
suffering ennui and weariness, as he had done at the fairy
Do-nothing&#8217;s, ending in a miserable death; but his attention
was soon after most alarmingly roused by hearing the
giant Snap-&#8217;em-up again in conversation with his cook,
who said, that if he wished for a good large dish of scolloped
children at dinner, it would be necessary to catch a
few more, as those he had already provided would scarcely
be a mouthful.</p>

<p>As the giant kept very fashionable hours, and always
waited dinner for himself till nine o&#8217;clock, there was still
plenty of time; so, with a loud grumble about the trouble,
he seized a large basket in his hand, and set off at
a rapid pace towards the fairy Teach-all&#8217;s garden. It was
very seldom that Snap-&#8217;em-up ventured to think of foraging
in this direction, as he had never once succeeded in carrying
off a single captive from the enclosure, it was so well
fortified and so bravely defended; but on this occasion,
<a name="p0140.png" id="p0140.png" href="#p0140.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">140</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>being desperately hungry, he felt as bold as a lion, and walked,
with outstretched hands, straight towards the fairy
Teach-all&#8217;s dinner-table, taking such prodigious strides, that
he seemed almost as if he would trample on himself.</p>

<p>A cry of consternation arose the instant this tremendous
giant appeared; and as usual on such occasions, when he
had made the same attempt before, a dreadful battle took
place. Fifty active little boys bravely flew upon the enemy,
armed with their dinner knives, and looked like a nest of
hornets, stinging him in every direction, till he roared with
pain, and would have run away, but the fairy Teach-all,
seeing his intention, rushed forward with the carving knife,
and brandishing it high over her head, she most courageously
stabbed him to the heart!</p>

<p>If a great mountain had fallen in the earth, it would have
seemed like nothing in comparison of the giant Snap-&#8217;em-up,
who crushed two or three houses to powder beneath
him, and upset several fine monuments that were to have
made people remembered for ever; but all this would have
seemed scarcely worth mentioning, had it not been for a
still greater event which occurred on the occasion, no less
than the death of the fairy Do-nothing, who had been indolently
looking on at this great battle, without taking the
trouble to interfere, or even to care who was victorious, but,
being also lazy about running away, when the giant fell, his
sword came with so violent a stroke on her head, that she
instantly expired.</p>

<p>Thus, luckily for the whole world, the fairy Teach-all
got possession of immense property, which she proceeded
without delay to make the best use of in her power.</p>

<p>In the first place, however, she lost no time in liberating
Master No-book from his hook in the larder, and gave him
a lecture on activity, moderation, and good conduct, which
he never afterwards forgot; and it was astonishing to see
the change that took place immediately in his whole thoughts
<a name="p0141.png" id="p0141.png" href="#p0141.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">141</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and actions. From this very hour, Master No-book became
the most diligent, active, happy boy in the fairy
Teach-all&#8217;s garden; and on returning home a month afterwards,
he astonished all the masters at school by his extraordinary
reformation. The most difficult lessons were a
pleasure to him,&mdash;he scarcely ever stirred without a book in
his hand,&mdash;never lay on a sofa again,&mdash;would scarcely even
sit on a chair with a back to it, but preferred a three-legged
stool,&mdash;detested holidays,&mdash;never thought any exertion a
trouble,&mdash;preferred climbing over the top of a hill to creeping
round the bottom,&mdash;always ate the plainest food in very
small quantities,&mdash;joined a Temperance Society!-and never
tasted a morsel till he had worked very hard and got an
appetite.</p>

<p>Not long after this, an old uncle, who had formerly been
ashamed of Master No-book&#8217;s indolence and gluttony, became
so pleased at the wonderful change, that, on his death,
he left him a magnificent estate, desiring that he should take
his name; therefore, instead of being any longer one of
the No-book family, he is now called Sir Timothy Bluestocking,&mdash;a
pattern to the whole country round, for the
good he does to every one, and especially for his extraordinary
activity, appearing as if he could do twenty things at
once. Though generally very good-natured and agreeable,
Sir Timothy is occasionally observed in a violent passion,
laying about him with his walking-stick in the most terrific
manner, and beating little boys within an inch of their
lives; but on inquiry, it invariably appears that he has
found them out to be lazy, idle, or greedy, for all the industrious
boys in the parish are sent to get employment from
him, while he assures them that they are far happier breaking
stones on the road, than if they were sitting idly in a
drawing-room with nothing to do. Sir Timothy cares very
little for poetry in general; but the following are his favourite
verses, which he has placed over the chimney-piece at a
<a name="p0142.png" id="p0142.png" href="#p0142.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span

<p class="top1">&ldquo;Thank you, a hundred times over, uncle David!&rdquo; said
Harry, when the story was finished. &ldquo;I shall take care
not to be found hanging any day on a hook in the larder!
Certainly, Frank, you must have spent a month with the

<p>&ldquo;It is very important. Harry, to choose the best course

bad habits grow stronger and stronger every minute, as if
an additional string were tied on daily, to keep us in the

<a name="p0143.png" id="p0143.png" href="#p0143.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">143</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>see which Harry and you would prefer copying,&rdquo; replied
Lady Harriet, smiling. &ldquo;The fool begins, when he is
young, with hating lessons, lying long in bed, and spending
all his money on trash. Any books he will consent to
read, are never about what is true or important; but he
wastes all his time and thoughts on silly stories that never
could have happened. Thus he neglects to learn what was
done, and thought, by all the great and good men who really
lived in former times, while even his Bible, if he has one,
grows dusty on the shelf. After so bad a beginning,
he grows up with no useful or interesting knowledge;
therefore his whole talk is to describe his own horses, his
own dogs, his own guns, and his own exploits; boasting
of what a high wall his horse can leap over, the number of
little birds he can shoot in a day, and how many bottles of
wine he can swallow without tumbling under the table.
Thus, &lsquo;glorying in his shame,&rsquo; he thinks himself a most
wonderful person, not knowing that men are born to do
much better things than merely to find selfish pleasure and
amusement for themselves. Presently he grows old, gouty,
and infirm&mdash;no longer able to do such prodigious achievements;
therefore now his great delight is, to sit with his
feet upon the fender, at a club all day, telling what a famous
rider, shooter, and drinker, he was long ago; but nobody
cares to hear such old stories; therefore he is called a
&lsquo;proser,&rsquo; and every person avoids him. It is no wonder
a man talks about himself, if he has never read or thought
about any one else. But at length his precious time has all
been wasted, and his last hour comes, during which he can
have nothing to look back upon but a life of folly and guilt.
He sees no one around who loves him, or will weep over
his grave; and when he looks forward, it is towards an
eternal world which he has never prepared to enter, and of
which he knows nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a terrible picture, grandmama!&rdquo; said Frank,
<a name="p0144.png" id="p0144.png" href="#p0144.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">144</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>rather gravely. &ldquo;I hope there are not many people like
that, or it would be very sad to meet with them. Now pray
let us have a pleasanter description of the sort of persons
you would like Harry and me to become.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first foundation of all is, as you already know,
Frank, to pray that you may be put in the right course and
kept in it, for of ourselves we are so sinful and weak that
we can do no good thing. Then feeling a full trust in the
Divine assistance, you must begin and end every day with
studying your Bible, not merely reading it, but carefully
endeavouring to understand and obey what it contains.
Our leisure should be bestowed on reading of wiser and
better people than ourselves, which will keep us humble
while it instructs our understandings, and thus we shall be
fitted to associate with persons whose society is even better
than books. Christians who are enlightened and sanctified
in the knowledge of all good things, will show us an example
of carefully using our time, which is the most valuable
of all earthly possessions. If we waste our money, we may
perhaps get more&mdash;if we lose our health, it may be restored&mdash;but
time squandered on folly, must hereafter be answered
for, and can never be regained. Whatever be your station
in life, waste none of your thoughts upon fancying how
much better you might have acted in some other person&#8217;s
place, but see what duties belong to that station in which
you live, and do what that requires with activity and diligence.
When we are called to give an account of our
stewardship, let us not have to confess at the last that we
wasted our one talent, because we wished to have been
trusted with ten; but let us prepare to render up what was
given to us, with joy and thankfulness, perfectly satisfied
that the best place in life is where God appoints, and where
He will guide us to a safe and peaceful end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; added Major Graham. &ldquo;You have two eyes in
your minds as well as in your bodies. With one of these
<a name="p0145.png" id="p0145.png" href="#p0145.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">145</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>we see all that is good or agreeable in our lot&mdash;with the
other we see all that is unpleasant or disappointing, and you
may generally choose which eye to keep open. Some of
my friends always peevishly look at the troubles and vexations
they endure, but they might turn them into good, by
considering that every circumstance is sent from the same
hand, with the same merciful purpose&mdash;to make us better
now and happier hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! my dear children,&rdquo; said Lady Harriet, &ldquo;it is time
now for retiring to Bedfordshire; so good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, grandmama! not yet,&rdquo; asked Harry, anxiously.
&ldquo;Give us five minutes longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then in the morning you will want to remain five
minutes more in bed. That is the way people learn to keep
such dreadfully late hours at last, Harry! I knew one very
rich old gentleman formerly, who always wished to sit up a
little later every night, and to get up a little later in the
morning, till at length, he ended by hiring a set of servants
to rise at nine in the evening, as he did himself, and to
remain in bed all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People should regulate their sleep very conscientiously,&rdquo;
added Major Graham, &ldquo;so as to waste as little time as possible;
and our good king George III. set us the example,
for he remarked, that six hours in the night were quite
enough for a man&mdash;seven hours for a woman, and eight for
a fool. Or perhaps, Harry, you might like to live by Sir
William Jones&#8217; rule:</p>

<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">One</span> fine morning in Charlotte Square, Peter Grey persuaded
a party of his companions to spend all the money
they had on cakes and sugar-plums, to make a splendid entertainment
under the trees, where they were to sit like a
horde of gypsies, and amuse themselves with telling fortunes
to each other. Harry and Laura had no one with them but
Betty, who gladly joined a group of nursery-maids at a distance,
leaving them to their own devices; upon which they
rushed up to Peter and offered their assistance, subscribing
all their pocket-money, and begging him to set forth and
obtain provisions for them as well as for himself. Neither
Harry nor Laura cared for eating the trash that was collected
on this occasion, and would have been quite as well
pleased to distribute it among their companions; but they
both enjoyed extremely the bustle of arranging this elegant
déjeuné<!-- original reads "déjèuné" --> or &ldquo;<i>disjune</i>,&rdquo; as Peter called it. Harry gathered
leaves off the trees to represent plates, on each of which
Peter arranged some of the fruit or sweetmeats he had purchased,
while they placed benches together as a table, and
borrowed Laura&#8217;s white India shawl for a table-cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like that grand public dinner we saw at the
<a name="p0147.png" id="p0147.png" href="#p0147.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">147</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Assembly Rooms one day!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, in an ecstacy
of admiration. &ldquo;We must have speeches and toasts like
real gentlemen and officers. Peter! if you will make a fine
oration, full of compliments to me, I shall say something wonderful
about you, and then Laura must beat upon the table
with a stick, to show that she agrees to all that we observe
in praise of each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or suppose we all take the names of some great personages,&rdquo;
added Peter, &ldquo;I shall be the Duke of Wellington,
and Laura, you must be Joseph Hume, and Harry, you are
Sir Francis Burdett, that we may seem as different as possible;
but here comes the usher of the black rod to disperse
us all! Mrs. Crabtree hurrying into the square, her very
gown flaming with rage! what can be the matter! she
must have smelled the sugar-plums a mile off! one comfort
is, if Harry and Laura are taken away, we shall have the
fewer people to divide these cakes among, and I could devour
every one of them, for my own share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Peter finished speaking, Mrs. Crabtree had come
close up to the table, and without waiting to utter a word,
or even to scold, she twitched up Laura&#8217;s shawl in her hand,
and thus scattered the whole feast in every direction on the
ground, after which she trampled the sugar-plums and cakes
into the earth, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew how it would be, as soon as I saw whose company
you were in, Master Harry! Peter Grey is the father
of mischief! he ought to be put into the monkey&#8217;s cage at
the <em>Geo</em>logical gardens! I would not be your maid, Master
Grey, for a hundred a-year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would need to buy a thrashing machine immediately,&rdquo;
said Peter, laughing; &ldquo;what a fine time I should have of
it! you would scarcely allow me, I suppose, to blow my porridge!
how long would it take you, Mrs. Crabtree, to make
quite a perfectly good boy of me? Perhaps a month, do
<a name="p0148.png" id="p0148.png" href="#p0148.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">148</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>you think? or to make me as good as Frank, it might possibly
require six weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six weeks!&rdquo; answered Mrs. Crabtree; &ldquo;six years, or
sixty, would be too short. You are no more like Mr.
Frank than a shilling is to a guinea, or a wax light to a
dip. If the news were told that you had been a good boy
for a single day, the very <em>statutes</em> in the streets would come
running along to see the wonder. No! no! I have observed
many surprising things in my day, but them great
pyramuses in Egypt will turn upside down before you turn
like Mr. Frank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some days after this adventure of Harry and Laura&#8217;s,
there arrived newspapers from London containing accounts
of a great battle which had been fought abroad. On that
occasion the British troops of course performed prodigies of
valour, and completely conquered the enemy, in consequence
of which, it was ordered by government, that, in every town,
and every village, and every house throughout the whole
kingdom, there should be a grand illumination.</p>

<p>Neither Harry nor Laura had ever heard of such a thing
as an illumination before, and they were full of curiosity to
know what it was like; but their very faces became lighted
up with joy, when Major Graham described that they would
see crowds of candles flaming in every window, tar-barrels
blazing on every hill, flambeaux glaring at the doors, and
transparencies, fire-works, and coloured lamps shining in
all the streets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How delightful! and walking out in the dark to see it,&rdquo;
cried Harry; &ldquo;that will be best of all! oh! and a whole
holiday! I hardly know whether I am in my right wits, or
my wrong wits, for joy! I wish we gained a victory every
day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a warrior you would be, Harry! Cæsar was nothing
to you,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;We might be satisfied with one
<a name="p0149.png" id="p0149.png" href="#p0149.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">149</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>good battle in a year, considering how many are killed and
wounded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I hope all the wounded soldiers will recover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or get pensions,&rdquo; added uncle David. &ldquo;It is a grand
sight, Frank, to see a whole nation rejoicing at once! In
general, when you walk out and meet fifty persons in the
street, they are all thinking of fifty different things, and
each intent on some business of his own, but on this occasion
all are of one mind and one heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank and Harry were allowed to nail a dozen of little
candlesticks upon each window in the house, which delighted
them exceedingly, and then, before every pane of glass,
they placed a tall candle, impatiently longing for the time
when these were to be illuminated. Laura was allowed to
carry a match, and assist in lighting them, but in the excess
of her joy, she very nearly made a bonfire of herself, as her
frock took fire, and would soon have been in a blaze, if
Frank had not hastily seized a large rug and rolled it round
her.</p>

<p>In every house within sight, servants and children were
to be seen hurrying about with burning matches, while hundreds
of lights blazed up in a moment, looking as if all the
houses in town had taken fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a waste of candles!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crabtree, angrily;
&ldquo;can&#8217;t people be happy in the dark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Crabtree!&rdquo; answered Frank, laughing.
&ldquo;They cannot be happy in the dark! People&#8217;s spirits are
always in exact proportion to the number of lights. If you
ever feel dull with one candle, light another; and if that
does not do, try a third, or a fourth, till you feel merry and
cheerful. We must not let you be candle-snuffer to-night,
or you will be putting them all out. You would snuff out
the sun itself, to save a shilling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The windows might perhaps be broken,&rdquo; added Laura;
&ldquo;for whatever pane of glass does not exhibit a candle, is to
<a name="p0150.png" id="p0150.png" href="#p0150.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">150</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>have a stone sent through it. Harry says the mob are all
glaziers, who break them on purpose to mend the damage
next day, which they will be paid handsomely for doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were many happy, joyous faces, to be seen that
evening in the streets, admiring the splendid illumination;
but the merriest party of all, was composed of Frank, Harry,
and Laura, under the command of uncle David, who had
lately suffered from a severe fit of the gout; but it seemed
to have left him this night, in honour of the great victory,
when he appeared quite as much a boy as either of his two
companions. For many hours they walked about in the
streets, gazing up at the glittering windows, some of which
looked as if a constellation of stars had come down for a
night to adorn them; and others were filled with the most
beautiful pictures of Britannia carrying the world on her
shoulders; or Mars showering down wreaths of laurel on
the Duke of Wellington, while victory was sitting at his
feet, and fame blowing a trumpet at his ear. Harry thought
these paintings finer than any he had ever seen before, and
stood for some moments entranced with admiration, on beholding
a representation in red, blue, yellow, and black, of
Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, all doing homage to St.
George mounted on a dragon, which breathed out fire and
smoke like a steam-boat. Nothing, however, occasioned
the party such a burst of delightful surprise, as when they
first beheld the line of blazing windows more than a mile
long, from the bottom of the Canongate to the highest pinnacle
of the Castle, where they seemed almost to meet the
stars shining above, in their perpetual glory. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo;
remarked Major Graham, when he pointed them out to his
young companions, &ldquo;there is a fit emblem of the difference
between earth and heaven. These lights nearer and
brighter to us at present; but when they have blazed and
glittered for one little hour, they come to an end; while
those above, which we see so dimly now, will continue to
<a name="p0151.png" id="p0151.png" href="#p0151.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">151</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>shine for ages and generations hereafter, till time itself is
no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Occasionally, during their progress, Harry felt very indignant
to observe a few houses perfectly dark; and whether
the family were sick, or out of town, or whatever the
reason might be, he scarcely became sorry when a frequent
crash might be heard, as the mob, determined to have their
own way this night, aimed showers of stones at the offending
windows, till the very frames seemed in danger of being
broken. At last uncle David led his joyous little party
into Castle Street, in which not a light was to be seen, and
every blind seemed carefully closed. A crowd had assembled,
with an evident intention to attack these melancholy
houses, when Major Graham suddenly caught hold of Harry&#8217;s
arm, on observing that he had privately picked up a
large stone, which he was in the very act of throwing with
his whole force at one of the defenceless windows. And
now the whole party stood stock still, while uncle David
said in a very angry and serious voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry! you heedless, mischievous boy! will you never
learn to consider a moment before you do what is wrong?
I am exceedingly displeased with you for this! What business
is it of yours whether that house be lighted up or
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, uncle David! surely it is very wrong not to obey
the government, and to be happy like everybody else! Besides,
you see the mob will break those windows at any
rate, so it is no matter if I help them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, for the same reason, if they were setting the
house on fire, I suppose you would assist the conflagration,
Harry. Your excuse is a very bad one; and when you
hear what I have to say about this house, let it be a lesson for
the rest of your life, never to judge hastily, nor to act rashly.
The officer to whom it belonged, has been killed in the great
battle abroad; and while we are rejoicing in the victory
<a name="p0152.png" id="p0152.png" href="#p0152.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">152</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>that his bravery helped to gain, his widow and children are
weeping within those walls, for the husband and father who
lies buried on a foreign shore. Think what a contrast these
shouts of joy must be to their grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, uncle David! how sorry I am!&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I
deserve to go home this moment, and not to see a candle
again for a week. It was very wrong of me indeed. I shall
walk all the way home, with my eyes shut, if you will only
excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Harry! that is not necessary! If the eyes of
your mind are open, to see that you have acted amiss, then
try to behave better in future. When people are happy
themselves, they are too apt to forget that others may be in
distress, and often feel quite surprised and provoked at
those who appear melancholy; but our turn must come like
theirs. Life is made up of sunshine and shadow, both of
which are sent for our good, and neither of them last, in
this world, for ever; but we should borrow part of our joys,
and part of our sorrows, from sympathy with all those we
see or know, which will moderate the excess of whatever is
our own portion in life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, the mob, which had been gradually increasing,
gave a tremendous shout, and were on the point of
throwing a torrent of stones at the dark, mournful house, which
had made so narrow an escape from Harry&#8217;s vengeance, when
Major Graham, forgetting his gout, hastily sprung upon a
lamp-post, and calling for attention, he made a speech to
the crowd, telling of the brave Captain <span class="nw">D&mdash;&mdash;</span> who had died
for his country, covered with wounds, and that his mourning
family was assembled in that house. Instantly the mob
became as silent and motionless as if they had themselves
been turned into stones; after which they gradually stole
away, with downcast eyes, and mournful countenances;
while it is believed that some riotous people, who had been
loudest and fiercest at first, afterwards stood at the top of the
<a name="p0153.png" id="p0153.png" href="#p0153.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">153</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>little street like sentinels, for more than an hour, to warn
every one who passed, that he should go silently along, in
respect for the memory of a brave and good officer. Not
another shout was heard in the neighbourhood that night;
and many a merry laugh was suddenly checked from reverence
for the memory of the dead, and the sorrow of the living;
while some spectators remarked, with a sigh of melancholy
reflection, that men must ever join trembling with
their mirth, because even in the midst of life they are in
death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we feel so much sorrow for this one officer and his
family, it shows,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;what a dreadful thing war is,
which costs the lives of thousands and tens of thousands in
every campaign, by sickness and fatigue, and the other
sources of misery that accompany every army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Frank! and yet there has scarcely been a year on
earth, while the world has existed, without fighting in some
country or another, for, since the time when Cain killed
Abel, men have been continually destroying each other.
Animals only fight in temporary irritation when they are
hungry, but pride, ambition, and folly of every kind, have
caused men to hate and massacre each other. Even religion
itself has caused the fiercest and most bloody conflicts,
though, if that were only understood and obeyed as it ought
to be, the great truths of Scripture would produce peace on
earth, and good-will among all the children of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole party had been standing for some minutes opposite
to the post-office, which looked like a rainbow of coloured
lamps, and Harry was beginning, for the twentieth
time, to try if he could count how many there were, when
Major Graham felt something twitching hold of his coat
pocket behind, and on wheeling suddenly round, he perceived
a little boy, not much older than Harry, darting rapidly
off in another direction, carrying his own purse and pocket-handkerchief
in his hand. Being still rather lame, and
<a name="p0154.png" id="p0154.png" href="#p0154.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">154</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>unable to move very fast, Major Graham could only vociferate
at the very top of his voice, &ldquo;Stop thief! stop thief!&rdquo; but
not a constable appeared in sight, so the case seemed desperate,
and the money lost for ever, when Frank observed
also what had occurred, and being of an active spirit, he flew
after the young thief, followed closely by Harry. An eager
race ensued, up one street, and down another, with marvellous
rapidity, while Frank was so evidently gaining ground,
that the thief at last became terrified, and threw away the
purse, hoping thus to end the chase; but neither of his pursuers
paused a moment to pick it up, they were so intent
upon capturing the little culprit himself. At length Frank
sprung forward and caught him by the collar, when a fierce
conflict ensued, during which the young thief was so ingenious,
that he nearly slipped his arms out of his coat, and
would have made his escape, leaving a very tattered garment
in their hands, if Harry had not observed this trick, and
held him by the hair, which, as it was not a wig, he could
not so easily throw off.</p>

<p>At this moment, a large coarse ruffianly-looking man
hurried up to the party, evidently intending to rescue the little
pick-pocket from their custody; so Frank called loudly for
help, while several police-officers who had been sent by Major
Graham, came racing along the street, springing their
rattles, and vociferating, &ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, the boy struggled more violently than ever to disentangle
himself, but Frank and Harry grasped hold of their
prisoner, as if they had been a couple of Bow Street officers,
till at length the tall fierce man thought it time to be off,
though not before he had given Harry a blow on the face,
that caused him to reel back, and fall prostrate on the pavement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s a brave little gentleman!&rdquo; said one of the constables,
helping him up, while another secured the thief.
&ldquo;You ought to be knighted for fighting so well! This boy
<a name="p0155.png" id="p0155.png" href="#p0155.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">155</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>you have taken is a sad fellow! He broke his poor mother&#8217;s
heart a year since by his wicked ways, and I have long
wished to catch him. A few weeks on the tread-mill now,
may save him from the gallows in future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems well practised in his business,&rdquo; observed
Major Graham. &ldquo;I almost deserved; however, to lose my
pocket-book for bringing it out in a night of so much
crowding and confusion. Some lucky person will be all
the richer, though I fear it is totally lost to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But here is your pocket-handkerchief, uncle David, if
you mean to shed any tears for your misfortune,&rdquo; whispered
Laura; &ldquo;how very lucky that you felt it going!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and very surprising too, for the trick was so cleverly
executed! That little rascal might steal the teeth out of
one&#8217;s head, without being noticed! When I was in India,
the thieves there were so expert that they really could draw
the sheets from under a person sleeping in bed, without disturbing
his slumbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With me, any person could do that, because I sleep so
very soundly,&rdquo; observed Frank. &ldquo;You might beat a military
drum at my ear, as they do in the boy&#8217;s sleeping rooms
at Sandhurst, and it would not have the smallest effect. I
scarcely think that even a gong would do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very different from me,&rdquo; replied Laura. &ldquo;Last
night I was awakened by the scratching of a mouse nibbling
in the wainscoat, and soon after it ran across my face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then pray sleep to-night with your mouth open, and a
piece of toasted cheese in it, to catch the mouse,&rdquo; said Major
Graham. &ldquo;That is the best trap I know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David,&rdquo; asked Frank, as they proceeded along
the street, &ldquo;if there is any hope of that wicked boy being
reformed, will you try to have him taught better? Being so
very young, he must have learned from older people to steal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly he must! It is melancholy to know how carefully
mere children are trained to commit the very worst
<a name="p0156.png" id="p0156.png" href="#p0156.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">156</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>crimes, and how little the mind of any young boy can be a
match for the cunning of old, experienced villains like those
who lead them astray. When once a child falls into the
snare of such practised offenders, escape becomes as impossible
as that of a bird from a limed twig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I believe,&rdquo; replied Frank. &ldquo;Grandmama told me
that the very youngest children of poor people, when first
sent to school in London, are often waylaid by those old
women who sell apples in the street, and who pretend to be
so good-natured that they make them presents of fruit. Of
course these are very acceptable, but after some time, those
wicked wretches propose that the child in return shall bring
them a book, or anything he can pick up at home, which
shall be paid for in apples and pears. Few little boys have
sufficient firmness not to comply, whether they like it or
not, and after that the case is almost hopeless, because,
whenever the poor victim hesitates to steal more, those cruel
women threaten to inform the parents of his misconduct,
which terrifies the boy into doing anything rather than be
found out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura. &ldquo;It all begins
so smoothly! No poor little boy could suspect any danger,
and then he becomes a hardened thief at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmama says, too, that pick-pockets, in London
used to have the stuffed figure of a man hung from the roof
of their rooms, and covered all over with bells, for the boys
to practise upon, and no one was allowed to attempt stealing
on the streets, till he could pick the pocket of this dangling
effigy, without ringing one of the many bells with which it
was ornamented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;when the young thieves saw
that figure hanging in the air, it might have reminded them
how soon they would share the same fate. Even crows
take warning when they see a brother crow hanging dead in
a field.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0157.png" id="p0157.png" href="#p0157.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">157</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;It is a curious thing of crows, Harry, that they certainly
punish thieves among themselves,&rdquo; observed Major Graham.
&ldquo;In a large rookery, some outcasts are frequently to
be observed living apart from the rest, and not allowed to
associate with their more respectable brethren. I remember
hearing formerly, that in the great rookery at <span class="nw">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>,
when all the other birds were absent, one solitary crow was
observed to linger behind, stealing materials for his nest
from those around, but next morning a prodigious uproar
was heard among the trees,&mdash;the cawing became so vociferous,
that evidently several great orators were agitating the
crowd, till suddenly the enraged crows flew in a body upon
the nest of their dishonest associate, and tore it in pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Frank. &ldquo;I do like to hear about all
the odd ways of birds and animals! Grandmama mentioned
lately, that, if you catch a crow, and fasten him down
with his back to the ground, he makes such an outcry, that
all his black brothers come wheeling about the place, till one
of them at last alights to help him. Immediately the treacherous
prisoner grapples hold of his obliging friend, and
never afterwards lets him escape; so, by fastening down
one after another, we might entrap the whole rookery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall try it some day!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, eagerly.
&ldquo;What fun to hear them all croaking and cawing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be croaking ourselves soon with colds, if we
do not hurry home,&rdquo; added uncle David. &ldquo;There is not a
thimbleful of light remaining, and your grandmama will be
impatient to hear all the news. This has really been a
most adventurous night, and I am sure none of us will soon
forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the whole party entered the drawing-room, in a
blaze of spirits, all speaking at once, to tell Lady Harriet
what had occurred, Mrs. Crabtree, who was waiting to take
a couple of little prisoners off to bed, suddenly gave an exclamation
of astonishment and dismay when she looked at
<a name="p0158.png" id="p0158.png" href="#p0158.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">158</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Harry, who now, for the first time since the robber had
knocked him down, approached the light, when he did, to be
sure, appear a most terrible spectacle! His jacket was
bespattered with mud, his shirt-frill torn and bloody, one
eye almost swelled out of his head, and the side of his face
quite black and blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What mischief have you been in now, Mr. Harry?&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Crabtree, angrily; &ldquo;you will not leave a
whole bone in your body, nor a whole shirt in your drawer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are honourable scars, Mrs. Crabtree,&rdquo; interrupted
Major Graham. &ldquo;Harry has been fighting my battles,
and gained a great victory! we must illuminate the nursery!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle David then told the whole story, with many droll
remarks, about his purse having been stolen, and said that,
as Harry never complained of being hurt, he never supposed
that anything of the kind could have occurred; but he felt
very much pleased to observe how well a certain young
gentleman was able to bear pain, as boys must expect hard
blows in the world, when they had to fight their way through
life, therefore it was well for them to give as few as they
could, and to bear with fortitude what fell to their own
share. Uncle David slyly added, that perhaps Harry put up
with these things all the better for having so much practice
in the nursery.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crabtree seemed rather proud of Harry&#8217;s manly
spirit, and treated him with a little more respect than usual,
saying, she would fetch him some hot water to foment his
face, if he would go straight up stairs with Laura. Now, it
very seldom happened, that Harry went straight anywhere,
for he generally swung down the bannisters again, or took
a leap over any thing he saw on the way, or got upon some
of the tables and jumped off, but this night he had resolutely
intended marching steadily up to bed, and advanced a considerable
way, when a loud shout in the street attracted his
attention. Harry stopped, and it was repeated again, so
<a name="p0159.png" id="p0159.png" href="#p0159.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">159</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>seizing Laura by the hand, they flew eagerly into Lady
Harriet&#8217;s dressing-room, and throwing open a window, they
picked up a couple of cloaks that were lying on a chair, and
both stepped out on a balcony to find out what was going
on; and in case any one should see them in this unusual
place, Harry quietly shut the window down, intending to
remain only one single minute. Minutes run very fast
away when people are amused, and nothing could be more
diverting than the sight they now beheld, for at this moment
a grand crash exploded of squibs and rockets from the Castle-hill,
which looked so beautiful in the dark, that it seemed
impossible to think of anything else. Some flew high in
the air, and then burst into the appearance of twenty fiery
serpents falling from the sky, others assumed a variety of
colours, and dropped like flying meteors, looking as if the stars
were all learning to dance, while many rushed into the air
and disappeared, leaving not a trace behind. Harry and
Laura stood perfectly entranced with admiration and delight,
till the fire-works neither burst, cracked, nor exploded any
more.</p>

<p>A ballad-singer next attracted their notice, singing the
tune of &ldquo;Meet me by moonlight,&rdquo; and afterwards Laura
shewed Harry the constellation of Orion mentioned in the
Bible, which, besides the Great Bear, was the only one she
had the slightest acquaintance with. Neither of them had
ever observed the Northern Lights so brilliant before, and
now they felt almost alarmed to see them shooting like lances
of fire across the sky, and glittering with many bright
colours, like a rainbow, while Laura remembered her
grandmama mentioning some days ago, that the poor natives
of Greenland believe these are the spirits of their fathers
going forth to battle.</p>

<p>Meantime, Lady Harriet called Frank, as usual, to his
evening prayers and reading in her dressing-room, where
it was well known that they were on no account to be
<a name="p0160.png" id="p0160.png" href="#p0160.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">160</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>disturbed. After having read a chapter, and talked very seriously
about all it was intended to teach, they had begun to
discuss the prospect of Frank going abroad very soon to
become a midshipman, and he was wondering much where
his first great shipwreck would take place, and telling Lady
Harriet about the loss of the Cabalvala, where the crew lived
for eight days on a barren rock, with nothing to eat but
a cask of raspberry jam, which accidentally floated within
their reach. Before Frank had finished his story, however,
he suddenly paused, and sprung upon his feet with an
exclamation of astonishment, while Lady Harriet, looking
hastily round in the same direction, became terrified to observe
a couple of faces looking in at the window. It was
so dark, she could not see what they were like, but a moment
afterwards the sash began slowly and heavily opening,
after which two figures leaped into the room, while Frank
flew to ring a peal at the bell, and Lady Harriet sunk into
her own arm-chair, covering her face with her hands, and
nearly fainting with fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, grandmama! do not be afraid! it is only
us!&rdquo; cried Harry; &ldquo;surely you know me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Harriet, looking up with
amazement. &ldquo;Harry and Laura!! impossible! how in
all the world did you get here? I thought you were both in
bed half an hour ago! Tiresome boy! you will be the
death of me some time or other! I wonder when you will
ever pass a day without deserving the bastinado!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not remember the good day last month, grandmama,
when I had a severe toothache, and sat all morning
beside the fire? Nobody found fault with me then, and I
got safe to bed, without a single Oh fie! from noon till
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Wonderful, indeed! what a pity I ever allowed that
tooth to be drawn, but you behaved very bravely on the occasion
of its being extracted. Now take yourselves off! I
<a name="p0161.png" id="p0161.png" href="#p0161.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">161</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>feel perfectly certain you will tell Mrs. Crabtree the exact
truth about where you have been, and if she punishes you,
remember that it is no more than you both deserve. People
who behave ill are their own punishers, and should be
glad that some one will kindly take the trouble to teach
them better.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem w24 pl4">
<div class="stanza">
<div>Not all the fine things that fine people possess,</div>
<div>Should teach them the poor to despise;</div>
<div>For &#8217;tis in good manners, and not in good dress,</div>
<div>That the truest gentility lies.</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">The</span> following Saturday morning, Frank, Harry, and Laura
were assembled before Lady Harriet&#8217;s breakfast hour,
talking over all their adventures on the night of the illumination;
and many a merry laugh was heard while uncle
David cracked his jokes and told his stories, for he seemed
as full of fun and spirits as the youngest boy in a play-ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old fellow!&rdquo; said he, lifting up Harry, and suddenly
seating him on the high marble chimney-piece.
&ldquo;That is the situation where the poor little dwarf, Baron
Borowloski was always put by his tall wife, when she wished
to keep him out of mischief, and I wonder Mrs. Crabtree
never thought of the same plan for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luckily there is no fire, or Harry would soon be roasted
for the Giant Snap-&#8217;em-up&#8217;s dinner,&rdquo; said Frank, laughing;
&ldquo;he looks up there like a China Mandarin. Shake your
head, Harry, and you will do quite as well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David!&rdquo; cried Harry, eagerly, &ldquo;pray let me see
you stand for one moment as you do at the club on a cold
day, with your feet upon the rug, your back to the fire,
<a name="p0163.png" id="p0163.png" href="#p0163.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">163</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and your coat-tails under your arms! Pray do, for one
minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle David did as he was asked, evidently expecting
the result, which took place, for Harry sprung upon his
back with the agility of a monkey, and they went round and
round the room at a full gallop, during the next five minutes,
while Lady Harriet said she never saw two such noisy
people, but it was quite the fashion now, since the king
of France carried his grandchildren, in the same way, every
morning, a picture of which had lately been shown to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I hope his majesty gets as good an appetite with
his romp as I have done,&rdquo; replied Major Graham, sitting
down. &ldquo;None of your tea and toast for me! that is
only fit for ladies. Frank, reach me these beef-steaks, and
a cup of chocolate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura now planted themselves at the window,
gazing at crowds of people who passed, while, by way of a
joke, they guessed what everybody had come out for, and
who they all were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a fat cook with a basket under her arm, going
to market,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Did you ever observe when Mrs.
Marmalade comes home, she says to grandmama, &lsquo;I have
desired a leg of mutton to come here, my lady! and I told
a goose to be over also,&rsquo; as if the leg of mutton and the
goose walked here, arm-in-arm, of themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at those children, going to see the wild beasts,&rdquo;
added Laura, &ldquo;and this little girl is on her way to buy a new
frock. I am sure she needs one! that old man is hurrying
along because he is too late for the mail-coach; and
this lady with a gown like a yellow daffodil, is going to take
root in the Botanical Gardens!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David! there is the very poorest boy I ever
saw!&rdquo; cried Harry, turning eagerly round; &ldquo;he has been
standing in the cold here, for ten minutes, looking the picture
of misery! he wears no hat, and has pulled his long
<a name="p0164.png" id="p0164.png" href="#p0164.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">164</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>lank hair to make a bow, about twenty times. Do come
and look at him! he is very pale, and his clothes seem to
have been made before he began to grow, for they are so
much too small, and he is making us many signs to open
the window. May I do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no! I never give to chance beggars of that kind,
especially young able-bodied fellows like that, because there
are so many needy, deserving people whom I visit,
who worked as long as they could, and whom I know
to be sober and honest. Most of the money we scatter to
street beggars goes straight to the gin-shop, and even the very
youngest children will buy or steal, to get the means of becoming
intoxicated. Only last week, Harry, the landlord of an
ale-house at Portobello was seen at the head of a long table,
surrounded with ragged beggar boys about twelve or fourteen
years of age, who were all perfectly drunk, and probably
your friend there might be of the party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! uncle David! this boy seems quite sober and
exceedingly clean, though he is so very poor!&rdquo; replied Laura;
&ldquo;his black trowsers are patched and repatched, his
jacket has faded into fifty colours, and his shoes are mended
in every direction, but still he looks almost respectable. His
face is so thin you might use it for a hatchet. I wish you
would take one little peep, for he seems so anxious to speak
to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay that! we all know what the youngster has to
tell! Probably a wife and six small children at home, or, if
you like it better, he will be a shipwrecked sailor at your
service. I know the whole affair already; but if you have
sixpence to spare, Laura, come with me after breakfast, and
we shall bestow it on poor blind Mrs. Wilkie, who has been
bed-ridden for the last ten years; or old paralytic Jemmy
Dixon the porter, who worked hard as long as he was able.
If you had twenty more sixpences, I could tell you of twenty
more people who deserve them as much.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0165.png" id="p0165.png" href="#p0165.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">165</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; added Lady Harriet. &ldquo;Street beggars, who
are young and able to work, like that boy, it is cruelty to
encourage. Parents bring up their children in profligate
idleness, hoping to gain more money by lying and cheating,
than by honest industry, and they too often succeed,
especially when the wicked mothers also starve and disfigure
these poor creatures, to excite more compassion. We must
relieve real distress, Harry, and search for it as we would
for hidden treasures, because thus we show our love to God
and man; but a large purse with easy strings will do more
harm than good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, Frank, how long I suspected that
old John Davidson was imposing upon me?&rdquo; said Major
Graham. &ldquo;He told such a dismal story always, that I never
liked to refuse him some assistance; but yesterday, when
he was here, the thought struck me by chance to say, &lsquo;What
a fine supper you had last night, John!&rsquo; You should have
seen the start he gave, and his look of consternation, when
he answered, &lsquo;Eh, Sir! how did ye hear of that! We got
the turkey very cheap, and none of us took more than two
glasses of toddy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That boy is pointing to his pockets, and making more
signs for us to open the window!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura.
&ldquo;What can it all mean! he seems so very anxious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Graham threw down his knife and fork&mdash;rose hastily
from breakfast&mdash;and flung open the window, calling out
in rather a loud, angry voice, &ldquo;What do you want, you idle
fellow? It is a perfect shame to see you standing there all
morning! Surely you don&#8217;t mean to say that an active
youngster like you would disgrace yourself by begging?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir! I want nothing!&rdquo; answered the boy respectfully,
but colouring to the deepest scarlet. &ldquo;I never asked
for money in my life, and I never will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s right, my good boy!&rdquo; answered the Major, instantly
changing his tone. &ldquo;What brings you here then?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0166.png" id="p0166.png" href="#p0166.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">166</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Please, Sir, your servants shut the door in my face, and
every body is so hasty like, that I don&#8217;t know what to do.
I can&#8217;t be listened to for a minute, though I have got something
very particular to say, that some one would be glad to
hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Graham now looked exceedingly vexed with himself,
for having spoken so roughly to the poor boy, who had
a thoughtful, mild, but care-worn countenance, which was
extremely interesting, while his manner seemed better than
his dress.</p>

<p>Frank was despatched, as a most willing messenger, to
bring the young stranger up stairs, while uncle David told
Harry that he would take this as a lesson to himself ever afterwards,
not to judge hastily from appearances, because it
was impossible for any one to guess what might be in the
mind of another; and he began to hope this boy, who was
so civil and well-spoken, might yet turn out to be a proper,
industrious little fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my lad! Is there anything I can do for you?&rdquo;
asked Major Graham, when Frank led him kindly into the
room. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evan Mackay, at your service. Please, Sir, did you
lose a pocket-book last Thursday, with your name on the
back, and nine gold sovereigns inside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! that I did, to my cost! Have you heard anything
of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy silently drew a parcel from his pocket, and without
looking up or speaking, he modestly placed it on the
table, then colouring very deeply, he turned away, and hurried
towards the door. In another minute he would have
been off, but Frank sprung forward and took hold of his
arm, saying, in the kindest possible manner, &ldquo;Stop, Evan!
Stop a moment! That parcel seems to contain all my uncle&#8217;s
money. Where did you get it? Who sent it here?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0167.png" id="p0167.png" href="#p0167.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">167</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;I brought it, Sir! The direction is on the pocket-book,
so there could be no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find it yourself then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! it was lying in the street that night when I ran
for a Doctor to see my mother, who is dying. She told
me now to come back directly, Sir, so I must be going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But let us give you something for being so honest,&rdquo;
said Frank. &ldquo;You are a fine fellow, and you deserve to be
well rewarded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only did my duty, Sir. Mother always says we should
do right for conscience&#8217; sake, and not for a reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! but you are justly entitled to this,&rdquo; said Major
Graham, taking a sovereign out of the purse. &ldquo;I shall do
more for you yet, but in the meantime here is what you have
honestly earned to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought so, Sir,&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;said the poor boy, looking
wistfully at the glittering coin. &ldquo;If I was quite sure there
could be no harm&mdash;&mdash;, but I must speak first to mother
about it, Sir! She has seen better days once, and she is
sadly afraid of my ever taking charity. Mother mends my
clothes, and teaches me herself, and works very hard in
other ways, but she is quite bed-ridden, and we have scarcely
anything but the trifle I make by working in the fields.
It is very difficult to get a job at all sometimes, and if you
could put me in the way of earning that money, Sir, it
would make mother very happy. She is a little particular,
and would not taste a morsel that I could get by asking for
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is being very proud!&rdquo; said Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sir! it is not from pride,&rdquo; replied Evan; &ldquo;but
mother says a merciful God has provided for her many
years, and she will not begin to distrust Him now. Her
hands are always busy, and her heart is always cheerful.
She rears many little plants by her bedside, which we sell,
and she teaches a neighbour&#8217;s children, besides sewing for
<a name="p0168.png" id="p0168.png" href="#p0168.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">168</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>any one who will employ her, for mother&#8217;s maxim always
was, that there can be no such thing as an idle Christian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true!&rdquo; said Lady Harriet. &ldquo;Even the apostles
were mending their nets and labouring hard, whenever
they were not teaching. Either the body or the mind should
always be active.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you saw mother, that is exactly her way, for she
does not eat the bread of idleness. Were a stranger to
offer us a blanket or a dinner in charity, she would rather
go without any than take it. A very kind lady brought her
a gown one day, but mother would only have it if she were
allowed to knit as many stockings as would pay for the
stuff. I dare not take a penny more for my work than is
due, for she says, if once I begin receiving alms, I might
get accustomed to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the good old Scotch feeling of former days,&rdquo;
observed Major Graham. &ldquo;It was sometimes carried too
far then, but there is not enough of it now. Your mother
should have lived fifty years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may say so, indeed, Sir! We never had a drop
of broth from the soup-kitchen all winter, and many a day
we shivered without a fire, though the society offered her
sixpence a-week for coals, but she says &lsquo;the given morsel
is soon done;&rsquo; and now, many of our neighbours who
wasted what they got, feel worse off than we, who are accustomed
to suffer want, and to live upon our honest labour.
Long ago, if mother went out to tea with any of our neighbours,
she always took her own tea along with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is being prouder than anybody else,&rdquo; observed
Frank, smiling. &ldquo;If my grandmama goes out to a tea-party,
she allows her friends to provide the fare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely, Sir! but that is different when people can
give as good as they get. Last week a kind neighbour
sent us some nice loaf bread, but mother made me take it
back, with her best thanks, and she preferred our own oat
<a name="p0169.png" id="p0169.png" href="#p0169.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">169</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>cake. She is more ready to give than to take, Sir, and divides
her last bannock, sometimes, with anybody who is
worse off than ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Frank, compassionately; &ldquo;how
much you must often have suffered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suffered!&rdquo; said the boy, with sudden emotion. &ldquo;Yes!
I have suffered! It matters nothing to be clothed in rags,&mdash;to
be cold and hungry now! There are worse trials than that!
My father died last year, crushed to death in a moment by his
own cart-wheels,&mdash;my brothers and sisters have all gone to the
grave, scarcely able to afford the medicines that might have
cured them,&mdash;and I am left alone with my poor dying mother.
It is a comfort that life is not very long, and we may trust
all to God while it lasts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you take us to see Mrs. Mackay?&rdquo; said Major
Graham, kindly. &ldquo;Laura, get your bonnet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sir! that young lady could not stay half a minute
in the place where my poor mother lives now. It is not a
pretty cottage such as we read of in tracts, but a dark cold
room, up a high stair, in the narrowest lane you ever saw,
with nothing to sit on but an old chest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that, Evan,&rdquo; replied Major Graham. &ldquo;You
and your mother have a spirit of honour and honesty that
might shame many who are lying on sofas of silk and damask.
I respect her, and shall assist you if it be possible.
Show us the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many dirty closes and narrow alleys were threaded by
the whole party, before they reached a dark ruinous staircase,
where Evan paused and looked round, to see whether Major
Graham still approached. He then slowly mounted one
flight of ancient crumbling steps after another, lighted by
patched and broken windows, till at last they arrived at a
narrow wooden flight, perfectly dark. After groping to the
summit, they perceived a time-worn door, the latch of
which was gently lifted by Evan, who stole noiselessly into
<a name="p0170.png" id="p0170.png" href="#p0170.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">170</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>the room, followed by uncle David and the wondering children.</p>

<p>There, a large cold room, nearly empty, but exceedingly
clean, presented itself to their notice. In one corner stood
a massive old chest of carved oak, surrounded with a perfect
glow of geraniums and myrtles in full blossom; beside
which were arranged a large antique Bible, a jug of cold
water, and a pile of coarsely-knitted worsted stockings.
Beyond these, on a bed of clean straw, lay a tall, emaciated
old woman, apparently in the last stage of life, with a face
haggard by suffering; and yet her thin, withered hands were
busily occupied with needle-work, while, in low, faltering
tones, she chanted these words,</p>

<div class="poem w20 pl6">
<div class="stanza notopspace">
<div>&ldquo;When from the dust of death I rise,</div>
<div>To claim my mansion in the skies,</div>
<div>This, this shall be my only plea,</div>
<div>Jesus has liv&#8217;d and died for me.&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="top1">&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; said Evan, wishing to arouse her attention.
&ldquo;Look, mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Mackay,&rdquo; added Major Graham, in a
voice of great consideration, while she languidly turned her
head towards the door. &ldquo;I have come to thank you for restoring
my purse this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are kindly welcome, Sir! What else could we
do!&rdquo; replied she, in a feeble, tremulous voice. &ldquo;The
money was yours, and the sooner it went out of our hands
the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was perfectly safe while it stayed there,&rdquo; added Major
Graham, not affecting to speak in a homely accent, nor
putting on any airs of condescension at all, but sitting down
on the old chest as if he had never sat on any thing but a
chest in his life before, and looking at the clean bare floor
with as much respect as if it had been a Turkey carpet.
<a name="p0171.png" id="p0171.png" href="#p0171.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">171</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>&ldquo;Your little boy&#8217;s pocket seems to be as safe as the Bank
of Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very true, Sir! My boy is honest; and it is
well to keep a good conscience, as that is all he has in this
world to live for. Many have a heavy conscience to carry
with a heavy purse; but these he need not envy. If we
are poor in this world, we are rich in faith; and I trust the
money was not even a temptation to Evan, because he
has learned from the best of all teachers, that it would &lsquo;profit
him nothing to gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, Mrs. Mackay! most true! We have come here
this morning to request that you and he will do me the favour
to accept of a small recompense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are already rewarded, Sir! This has been an opportunity
of testifying to our own hearts that we desire to do
right in the eye of God. At the same time, it was Providence
who kindly directed my son&#8217;s steps to the place where
that money was lying; and if anything seems justly due to
poor Evan, let him have it. My wants are few, and must
soon be ended. But oh! when I look at that boy, and
think of the long years he may be struggling with poverty
and temptation, my heart melts within me, and my whole
spirit is broken. Faith itself seems to fail, and I could be
a beggar for him now! It is not money I would ask, Sir,
because that might soon be spent; but get him some honest
employment, and I will thank you on my very knees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evan seemed startled at the sudden energy of his mother&#8217;s
manner, and tears sprung into his eyes while she spoke
with a degree of agitation so different from what he had
ever heard before; but he struggled to conceal his feelings,
and she continued with increasing emotion,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bodily suffering, and many a year of care and sorrow,
are fast closing their work on me. The moments are passing
away like a weaver&#8217;s shuttle; and if I had less anxiety
<a name="p0172.png" id="p0172.png" href="#p0172.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">172</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>about Evan, how blessed a prospect it would appear; but
that is the bitterness of death to me now. My poor, poor
boy! I would rather hear he was in the way of earning his
livelihood, than that he got a hundred a-year. Tell me,
Sir!&mdash;and oh! consider you are speaking to a dying
creature&mdash;can you possibly give him any creditable employment,
where he might gain a crust of bread, and be independent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I honour your very proper feeling on the subject, Mrs.
Mackay, and shall help Evan to the best of my ability,&rdquo; replied
Major Graham, in a tone of seriousness and sincerity.
&ldquo;To judge by these fine geraniums, he must be fond of
cultivating plants; and we want an under-gardener in the
country; therefore he shall have that situation without loss
of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother! mother! speak no more of dying! You
will surely get better now!&rdquo; said Evan, looking up, while
his thin pale face assumed a momentary glow of pleasure.
&ldquo;Try now to get better! I never could work as well, if you
were not waiting to see me come home! We shall be so
happy now!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Yes! I am happy!&rdquo; said Mrs. Mackay, solemnly looking
towards heaven, with an expression that could not be
mistaken. &ldquo;The last cord is cut that bound me to the
earth; and may you, Sir, find hereafter the blessings that
are promised to those who visit the fatherless and widows
in their affliction.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">Next</span> Monday morning, at an early hour, Frank had again
found his way with great difficulty to the house of Widow
Mackay, where he spent all his pocket money on two fine
scarlet geraniums. If they had been nettles or cabbages,
he would have felt the same pleasure in buying them; and
his eyes sparkled with animation when he entered uncle
David&#8217;s room, carrying them in his hand, and saying, &ldquo;I
was so glad to have some money! I could spare it quite
well. There is no greater pleasure in being rich than to
help such poor people as Evan Mackay and his poor sick
mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Frank, I often wonder that any enjoyment of
wealth can be considered equal to the exercise of kind feelings,
for surely the most delightful sensation in this world
is, to deserve and receive the grateful affection of those
around us,&rdquo; replied Major Graham. &ldquo;What a wretched
being Robinson Crusoe was on the desert island alone,
though he found chests of gold, and yet many people are as
unblessed in the midst of society, who selfishly hoard
<a name="p0174.png" id="p0174.png" href="#p0174.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">174</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>fortunes for themselves, unmindful of the many around who
ought to be gratefully receiving their daily benefits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was laughing to read lately of the West India slaves,
who collected money all their lives in an old stocking,&rdquo; said
Frank, &ldquo;and who watched with delight as it filled from year
to year; but the bank is only a great stocking, where misers
in this country lay up treasures for themselves which they
are never to enjoy, though too often they lay up no treasures
for themselves in a better world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I frequently think, Frank, if all men were as liberal,
kind, and forbearing to each other as the Holy Scriptures
enjoin, and if we lived as soberly, temperately, and godly
together, what a paradise this world would become, for many
of our worst sufferings are brought on by our own folly, or
the unkindness of others. And certainly, if we wished to
fancy the wretchedness of hell itself, it would only be necessary
to imagine what the earth would become if all fear of
God and man were removed, and every person lived as his
own angry, selfish passions would dictate. Great are the
blessings we owe to Christianity, for making the world even
what it is now, and yet greater would those blessings be, if
we obeyed it better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is exactly what grandmama says, and that we must
attend to the Gospel from love and gratitude to God, rather
than from fear of punishment or hope of reward, which is
precisely what we saw in poor widow Mackay and Evan,
who seemed scarcely to expect a recompense for behaving
so honestly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the more remarkable in them, as few Christians
now are above receiving a public recompense for doing
their duty to God. Men of the world have long rewarded
each other with public dinners and pieces of plate, to express
the utmost praise and admiration, but of late I never
open a newspaper without reading accounts of one clergyman
or another, who has been &lsquo;honoured with a public
<a name="p0175.png" id="p0175.png" href="#p0175.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">175</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>breakfast!&rsquo; when he is presented by an admiring circle with
&lsquo;a gold watch and appendages!&rsquo; or a Bible with a complimentary
inscription, or a gown, or a pair of bands, worked
by the ladies of his congregation! and all this, for labouring
among his own people, in his own sphere of duty!
What would Archbishop Leighton and the old divines have
said to any one who attempted to rouse their vanity in this
way, with the praise of men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you say reminds me, uncle David,&rdquo; said Frank,
&ldquo;that we have been asked to present our Universal-Knowledge-Master
with a silver snuff-box, as a testimonial
from the scholars in my class, because he is going soon to
Van Dieman&#8217;s Land, therefore I hope you will give me
half-a-crown to subscribe, or I shall be quite in disgrace
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one shilling shall you receive from me, my good
friend, for any such purpose! a snuff-box, indeed! your
master ought to show his scholars an example of using
none! a filthy waste of health, money, and time. Such
testimonials should only be given, as Archbishop Magee
says, to persons who have got into some scrape, which
makes their respectability doubtful. If my grocer is ever
publicly presented with a pair of silver sugar tongs, I shall
think he has been accused of adulterating the sugar, and
give over employing him directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;you will be having a silver thimble
voted to you for hemming six pocket-handkerchiefs in
six years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know one clergyman, Dr. Seton, who conscientiously
refused a piece of plate, which was about to be presented
in this way,&rdquo; continued Major Graham; &ldquo;he accidentally
heard that such a subscription was begun among the rich
members of his congregation, and instantly stopped it, saying,
&lsquo;Let your testimonial consist in a regular attendance at
church, and let my sole reward be enjoyed hereafter, when
<a name="p0176.png" id="p0176.png" href="#p0176.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">176</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>you appear as my crown of joy and rejoicing in the presence
of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Edward Graham&#8217;s particular friend, Captain Gordon,
at last wrote to say, that the Thunderbolt, 74, having been put
in commission for three years, was about to sail for the African
station, therefore he wished Frank to join without delay;
and as a farther mark of his regard, he promised that
he would endeavour to keep his young protege employed
until he had served out his time, because a midshipman once
paid off, was like a stranded whale, not very easily set afloat
again.</p>

<p>Lady Harriet sighed when she read the letter, and looked
paler all that day, but she knew that it was right and necessary
for Frank to go, therefore she said nothing to distress
him on the occasion, only in her prayers and explanations
of the Bible that evening, there was a deeper tone of feeling
than ever, and a cast of melancholy, which had rarely been
the case before, while he spoke much of that meeting in a
better world, which is the surest hope and consolation of
those Christians who separate on earth, and who know not
what a day, and still less what many years, may bring forth.</p>

<p>Major Graham tried to put a cheerful face on the matter
also, though he evidently felt very sorry indeed about parting
with Frank, and took him out a long walk to discuss
his future prospects, saying, &ldquo;Now you are an officer and
a gentleman, entitled therefore to be treated with new respect
and attention, by all your brother officers, naval or
military, in his Majesty&#8217;s service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank himself, being a boy of great spirit and enterprize,
felt glad that the time had really come for his being
afloat, and examining all the world over with his own eyes;
but he said that his heart seemed as if it had been put in a
swing, it fell so low when he thought of leaving his dear
happy home, and then it rose again higher than ever at the
very idea of being launched on the wide ocean, and going
<a name="p0177.png" id="p0177.png" href="#p0177.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">177</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>to the countries he had so often read of, where battles had
been fought and victories won.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank!&rdquo; said Peter Grey, who was going to join the
Thunderbolt, in about a fortnight afterwards, &ldquo;you have
no idea how beautiful I looked in uniform to-day! I tried
mine on, and felt so impatient to use my dirk, I could have
eat my dinner with it, instead of employing a common
knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never forget to be hungry, Peter,&rdquo; said Frank,
laughing. &ldquo;But now you are like the old Lord Buchan,
who used to say he could cook his porridge in his helmet,
and stir it with his broad-sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Major Graham, &ldquo;you both intend to become
very distinguished officers, and to leave a name at
which the world grows pale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Peter. &ldquo;All the old heroes we
read of shall be mere nobodies compared to me! I mean
to lose a leg or an arm in every <span class="nw">battle,&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Till nothing is left of you but your shirt-collar and
shoe-strings,&rdquo; interrupted Frank, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No! What remains of me at last shall die a Peer
of the realm,&rdquo; continued Peter. &ldquo;We must climb to the top
of the tree, Frank! What title do you think I should take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Cockpit would suit you best for some time,
Peter! It will not be so easy a business to rise as you
think. Every one can run a race, but very few can win,&rdquo;
observed Major Graham. &ldquo;The rarest thing on earth is to
succeed in being both conspicuous and respectable. Any
dunce may easily be either the one or the other, but the
chief puzzle with most men is, how to be both. In your
profession there are great opportunities, but at the same
time let me warn you, that the sea is not a bed of roses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, uncle David! but I hope it will become a field of
laurels to us,&rdquo; replied Frank, laughing. &ldquo;Now tell me
<a name="p0178.png" id="p0178.png" href="#p0178.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">178</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>in real earnest who you think was the greatest of our naval
heroes till now, when Peter is to cut them all out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must wait a few years. It is a long ladder to run
up before reaching the top. In France, the king&#8217;s sons
are all born Field Marshals, but nobody in this country is
born an Admiral. The great Lord Duncan served during
half-a-century before gaining his most important victory,
but previous to that, he paved the way to success, not by
mere animal courage alone, but by being so truly good and
religious a man, that his extraordinary firmness and benevolence
of character gained the confidence and respect of all
those who served with him, and therefore half his success
in battle was owing to his admirable conduct during peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have heard!&rdquo; replied Frank; &ldquo;and when there
was mutiny in every other ship, the Admiral&#8217;s own crew
remained faithful to him. How much better it is to be
obeyed from respect and attachment than from fear, which
is a mean feeling that I hope neither to feel myself, nor to
excite in others. I wish to be like Nelson, who asked,
&lsquo;What is fear? I never saw it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Frank! Nelson was said to be &lsquo;brave as a lion,
and gentle as a lamb.&rsquo; Certainly both he and Lord Duncan
were pre-eminently great; but neither Lord Duncan,
nor any other enlightened Christian, would have said what
Lord Nelson did, with his latent breath&mdash;&lsquo;I have not been
a great sinner!&rsquo; No mortal could lift up his eyes at the
day of judgment, and repeat those words again; for every
man that breathes the breath of life is a great sinner. We
are living in God&#8217;s own world without remembering him,
continually; and amidst thousands of blessings we disobey
him. The chief purpose for which men are created, is to
glorify God, and to prepare for entering his presence in a
better world; but instead of doing so, we live as if there
were no other object to live for, than our own pleasures and
amusements on earth. How, then, can we be otherwise
<a name="p0179.png" id="p0179.png" href="#p0179.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">179</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>than great sinners? I hope, Frank, that you will endeavour
to be, like Lord Duncan, not merely a good officer, but also
a good Christian; for, besides fighting the battles of your
country, you must gain a great victory over yourself, as all
men must either conquer their own evil dispositions, or
perish for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Harriet was particularly earnest in entreating Frank
to write frequently home; observing, that she considered it
a religious duty in all children, to shew their parents this attention,
as the Bible says that &ldquo;a wise son maketh a glad
father,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the father of the righteous shall greatly
rejoice;&rdquo; but on the contrary, too many young persons leave
their parents to mourn in suspense and anxiety, as to the
health and happiness of those whom they love more than
they can ever love any one else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us of every thing that interests you, and even all
about the spouting whales, flying fish, and dying dolphins,
which you will of course see,&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;Be sure to
write us also, how many albatrosses you shoot, and whether
you are duly introduced to Neptune at the Cape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Laura! but Bishop Heber&#8217;s Journal, or any other
book describing a voyage to the Cape, mentions exactly the
same thing. It will quite bring me home again when I
speak to you all on paper; and I shall be able to fancy what
everybody will say when my letter is read. Mrs. Darwin
sent for me this morning on particular business; and it was
to say that she wished me, in all the strange countries
where the Thunderbolt touched, to employ my spare moments
in chasing butterflies, that as many as possible might
be added to her museum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital! How like Mrs. Darwin!&rdquo; exclaimed Major
Graham, laughing. &ldquo;You will of course be running all over
Africa, hat in hand, pursuing painted butterflies, till you get a
<i>coup de soleil</i>, like my friend Watson, who was killed by one.
Poor fellow! I was with him then, and it was a frightful
<a name="p0180.png" id="p0180.png" href="#p0180.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">180</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>scene. He wheeled round several times, in a sort of convulsion,
till he dropped down dead in my arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall gild the legs and bills of some ducks before
leaving home, and send them to her as a present from Sierra
Leone,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;The wings might be died scarlet,
which would look quite foreign; and if an elephant falls in
my way, it shall be stuffed and forwarded by express.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David! Do you remember what fun we had,
when you sent Mrs. Darwin that stuffed bear in a present!
I was desired to announce that a foreigner of distinction
had arrived to stay at her house. What a bustle she was in
on hearing that he brought letters of introduction from you,
and intended to remain some time. Then we told her that
he could not speak a word of English, and brought &lsquo;a Pole&rsquo;
with him; besides which he had once been a great dancer.
Oh! how amusing it was, when she at last ventured into
the passage to be introduced, and saw her fine stuffed bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever people collect,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;every good-natured
person assists. I mean to begin a collection of
crooked sixpences immediately; therefore, pray never spend
another, but give me as many as you can spare; and the
more crooked the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sing a song a sixpence!&rdquo; said Frank, laughing.
&ldquo;Laura should begin to collect diamonds for a necklace,
and perhaps it might be all ready before she comes out. I
shall return home on purpose to see you then, Laura.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray do, Master Frank,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crabtree, with more
than usual kindness; &ldquo;we shall have great rejoicings on the
occasion of seeing you back&mdash;an ox roasted alive, as they
do in England, and all them sort of Tom-fooleries. I&#8217;ll
dance a jig then myself for joy&mdash;you certainly are a wonderful
good boy, considering that I had not the managing of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank&#8217;s departure was delayed till after the examination
of his school, because Mr. Lexicon had requested that, being
the best scholar there, he might remain to receive a whole
<a name="p0181.png" id="p0181.png" href="#p0181.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">181</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>library of prize-books, and a whole pocketful of medals;
for, as Peter remarked, &ldquo;Frank Graham deserved any reward,
because he learned his lessons so perfectly, that he
could not say them wrong even if he wished!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura were allowed to attend on the great occasion,
that they might witness Frank&#8217;s success; and never,
certainly, had they seen any thing so grand in their lives
before! A hundred and forty boys, all dressed in white
trowsers and yellow gloves, were seated in rows, opposite to
six grave learned-looking gentlemen, in wigs and spectacles,
who seemed as if they would condemn all the scholars to
death!</p>

<p>The colour mounted into Harry&#8217;s cheeks with delight,
and the tears rushed into his eyes, when he saw Frank,
whose face was radiant with good-humour and happiness,
take his place as head boy in the school. All his companions
had crowded round Frank as he entered, knowing that
this was his last appearance in the class; while he spoke a
merry or a kind word to each, leaning on the shoulder of
one, and grasping the hand of another with cordial kindness,
for he liked everybody, and everybody liked him. No one
envied Frank being dux, because they knew how hard he
worked for that place, and how anxious he had been to help
every other boy in learning as cleverly as himself; for all
the boobies would have become duxes if Frank could have
assisted them to rise, while many an idler had been made
busy by his attention and advice. No boy ever received, in
one day, more presents than Frank did on this occasion
from his young friends, who spent all their pocket-money
in pen-knives and pencil-cases, which were to be kept by
Frank, in remembrance of them, as long as he lived; and
some of his companions had a tear in their eye on bidding
him farewell, which pleased him more than all their gifts.</p>

<p>Major Graham took his place, with more gravity than
usual, among the judges appointed to distribute the prizes;
<a name="p0182.png" id="p0182.png" href="#p0182.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">182</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and now, during more than two hours, the most puzzling
questions that could be invented were put to every scholar
in succession, while Frank seemed always ready with an
answer, and not only spoke for himself, but often good-naturedly
prompted his neighbours, in so low a tone that no one
else heard him. His eyes brightened, and his face grew red
with anxiety, while even his voice shook at first; but before
long Frank collected all his wits about him, and could construe
Latin or repeat Greek with perfect ease, till at length
the whole examination concluded, and the great Dr. Clifford,
who had lately come all the way from Oxford, was requested
to present the prizes. Upon this he rose majestically
from his arm-chair, and made a long speech, filled as
full as it could hold with Latin and Greek. He praised
Homer and Horace for nearly twenty minutes, and brought
in several lines from Virgil, after which he turned to Frank,
saying, in a tone of great kindness and condescension,
though at the same time exceedingly pompous,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems almost a pity that this young gentleman&mdash;already
so very accomplished a scholar&mdash;who is, I may say, a
perfect <i>multum in parvo</i>, should prematurely pause in his
classical career to enter the navy; but in every situation of
life his extraordinary activity of mind, good temper, courage
and ability, must render him an honour to his country
and his profession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Clifford now glanced over the list of prizes, and read
aloud&mdash;&ldquo;First prize for Greek&mdash;Master Graham!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank walked gracefully forward, coloured and bowed,
while a few words of approbation were said to him, and a
splendidly-bound copy of Euripides was put into his hands
by Dr. Clifford, who then hastily read over the catalogue of
prizes to himself, in an audible voice, and in a tone of great
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First prize for Latin!&mdash;Master Graham! First for algebra,&mdash;first
for geography,&mdash;first for mathematics,&mdash;all
<a name="p0183.png" id="p0183.png" href="#p0183.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">183</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Master Graham!!!&mdash;and last, not least, a medal for general
good conduct, which the boys are allowed to bestow
upon the scholar they think most deserving,&mdash;and here
stands the name of Master Graham again!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Clifford paused, while the boys all stood up for a
moment and clapped their hands with enthusiasm, as a token
of rejoicing at the destination of their own medal.</p>

<p>For the first time Frank was now completely overcome,&mdash;he
coloured more deeply than before, and looked gratefully
round, first at his companions, then at his master, and last
at Major Graham, who had a tear standing in his eye when
he smiled upon Frank, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>Frank&#8217;s lip quivered for a moment, as if he would burst
into tears, but with a strong effort he recovered himself, and
affectionately grasping his uncle&#8217;s hand, hastily resumed his
place on the bench, to remain there while his companions
received the smaller prizes awarded to them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harry had been watching Frank with a feeling
of joy and pride, such as he never experienced before,
and could scarcely refrain from saying to every person near
him, &ldquo;That is my brother!&rdquo; He looked at Frank long and
earnestly, wishing to be like him, and resolving to follow his
good example at school. He gazed again and again, with
new feelings of pleasure and admiration, till gradually his
thoughts became melancholy, while remembering how soon
they must be separated; and suddenly the terrible idea darted
into his mind, &ldquo;Perhaps we never may meet again!&rdquo;
Harry tried not to think of this; he turned his thoughts to
other subjects; he forced himself to look at anything that
was going on, but still these words returned with mournful
apprehension to his heart, &ldquo;Perhaps we never may meet
again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank&#8217;s first action, after the examination had been concluded,
was hastily to gather up all his books, and bring a
sight of them to Harry and Laura; but what was his
<a name="p0184.png" id="p0184.png" href="#p0184.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">184</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>astonishment when, instead of looking at the prizes, Harry
suddenly threw his arms round his neck, and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear&mdash;dear boy! what has happened!&rdquo; exclaimed
Frank, affectionately embracing him, and looking much
surprised. &ldquo;Tell me, dear Harry, has any thing distressed
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know very well, Frank! but you are going
away,&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I wish I had been a better boy! I
would do any thing you bid me now!&mdash;but I shall never be
so happy again&mdash;no! never, without you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dear Harry! you will have Laura and grandmama,
and uncle David, all left, and I am coming back some day!
Oh! what a happy meeting we shall have then!&rdquo; said
Frank, while the tears stood in his eyes; and drawing
Harry&#8217;s arm within his own, they walked slowly away together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very&mdash;very anxious for you and Laura to be happy,&rdquo;
continued Frank, in the kindest manner; &ldquo;but, dear
Harry, will you not take more care to do as you are bid,
and not always to prefer doing what you like! Mrs. Crabtree
would not be half so terrible if you did not provoke her
by some new tricks every day. I almost like her myself;
for as the old proverb says, &lsquo;her bark is worse than her
bite;&rsquo; and she often reminds me of that funny old fable,
where the mice were more afraid of the loud, fierce-looking
cock, than of the sleek, smooth-looking cat, for there are
people carrying gentler tongues yet quite as difficult to deal
with. At the same time, seeing how uncomfortable you
and Laura both feel with Mrs. Crabtree, I have written a
letter to papa, asking, as my last and only request on leaving
home, that he will make a change of ministry, and
he is always so very kind, that I feel sure he will grant it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How good of you, Frank!&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I am sure it
is our own faults very often when we are in disgrace, for
<a name="p0185.png" id="p0185.png" href="#p0185.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">185</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>we are seldom punished till we deserve it; but I am
so sorry you are going away, that I can think of nothing
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I, very sorry indeed; but my best comfort, when
far from home, would be, to think that you and Laura are
happy, which will be the case when you become more watchful
to please grandmama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very true, Frank! and I would rather offend
twenty Mrs. Crabtrees than one grandmama; but perhaps
uncle David may send me to school now, when I shall try
to be like you, sitting at the top of the class, and getting
prizes for good behaviour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Harry! my pleasantest days at school have been
those when I was busiest, and you will find the same thing.
How delightful it was, going over and over my tasks till they
were quite perfect, and then rushing out to the play-ground,
where my mind got a rest, while my body was active; you
know it is seldom that both mind and body work at once,
and the best way of resting the one is, to make the other
labour. That is probably the reason, Harry, why games
are never half so pleasant as after hard study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Harry, doubtfully; &ldquo;but I always
hate any thing that I am obliged to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then never be a sailor, as I shall be obliged to do fifty
things a-day that I would rather not; for instance, to get up
in the middle of the night, when very likely dreaming
about being at home again; but, as grandmama says, it is
pleasant to have some duties, for life would not get on well
without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I don&#8217;t know!&mdash;we could find plenty
to do ourselves, without anybody telling us. I should like
to-morrow, to watch the boys playing at cricket, and to see
the races, and the Diorama, and in the evening to shoot
our bows and arrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good Sir! what the better would you, or
<a name="p0186.png" id="p0186.png" href="#p0186.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">186</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>anybody else, be of such a life as that! Not a thing in this
world is made to be useless, Harry; the very weeds that
grow in the ground are for some serviceable purpose, and
you would not wish to be the only creature on earth living
entirely for yourself. It would be better if neither of us had
ever been born, than that the time and opportunities which
God gives us for improving ourselves and doing good to
others, should all be wasted. Let me hope, Harry, when I
am away, that you will often consider how dull grandmama
may then feel, and how happy you might make her by being
very attentive and obedient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Frank! but I could never fill your place!&mdash;that is
quite impossible! Nobody can do that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try!&mdash;only try, Harry! grandmama is very easily
pleased when people do their best. She would not have
felt so well satisfied with me, if that had not been the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank!&rdquo; said Harry, sorrowfully, &ldquo;I feel as if ten brothers
were going away instead of one, for you are so good
to me! I shall be sure to mention you in my prayers, because
that is all I can do for you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all, Harry! though that is a great deal; you must
write to me often, and tell me what makes you happy or
unhappy, for I shall be more interested than ever, now that
we are separated. Tell me everything about my school-fellows,
too, and about Laura. There is no corner of the
wide world where I shall not think of you both every day,
and feel anxious about the very least thing that concerns
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boys!&rdquo; said Major Graham, who had joined
them some moments before, &ldquo;it is fortunate that you have
both lived always in the same home, for that will make you
love each other affectionately as long as you live. In England,
children of one family are all scattered to different
schools, without any one to care whether they are attached or
not, therefore their earliest and warmest friendships are
<a name="p0187.png" id="p0187.png" href="#p0187.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">187</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>formed with strangers of the same age, whom they perhaps
never see again, after leaving school. In that case, brothers
have no happy days of childhood to talk over in future life,
as you both have,&mdash;no little scrapes to remember, that they
got into together&mdash;no pleasures enjoyed at the same moment
to smile at the recollection of, and no friction of their tempers
in youth, such as makes every thing go on smoothly between
brothers when they grow older; therefore, when at last
grown up and thrown together, they scarcely feel more mutual
friendship and intimacy than any other gentlemen testify
towards each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say that is very true,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Tom
Brownlow tells me when his three brothers come home from
Eton, Harrow, and Durham, they quarrel so excessively, that
sometimes no two of them are on speaking terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all improbable,&rdquo; observed Major Graham. &ldquo;In
every thing we see how much better God&#8217;s arrangements are
than our own. Families were intended to be like a little
world in themselves&mdash;old people to govern the young
ones&mdash;young people to make their elders cheerful&mdash;grown-up
brothers and sisters to show their juniors a
good example&mdash;and children to be playthings and companions
to their seniors, but that is all at an end in the present
system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Andrew says that large families &lsquo;squander&rsquo; themselves
all over the earth now,&rdquo; said Frank, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!<!-- original has spurious closing quote --> very young children are thrust into preparatory
schools&mdash;older boys go to distant academies&mdash;youths to College&mdash;and
young men are shipped off abroad, while who
among them all can say his heart is in his own home? Parents
in the meantime, finding no occupation or amusement in
educating their children, begin writing books, perhaps
theories of education, or novels; and try to fill up the rest
of their useless hours with plays, operas, concerts, balls, or
clubs. If people could only know what is the best happiness
<a name="p0188.png" id="p0188.png" href="#p0188.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">188</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>of this life, it certainly depends on being loved by
those we belong to; for nothing can be called peace on
earth, which does not consist in family affection, built upon
a strong foundation of religion and morality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Edward Graham felt very proud of Frank, as all gentlemen
are of their eldest sons, and wrote a most affectionate
letter on the occasion of his going to sea, promising to
meet him at Portsmouth, and lamenting that he still felt so
ill and melancholy he could not return home, but meant to
try whether the baths in Germany would do him any good.
In this letter was enclosed what he called &ldquo;Frank&#8217;s first
prize-money,&rdquo; the largest sum the young midshipman had
ever seen in his life, and before it had been a day in his possession,
more than the half was spent on presents to his
friends. Not a single person seemed to be forgotten except
himself; for Frank was so completely unselfish, that Peter
Grey once laughingly said, &ldquo;Frank scarcely remembers
there is such a person as himself in the world, therefore it is
astonishing how he contrives to exist at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that be his worst fault, you shew him a very opposite
example, Peter,&rdquo; said Major Graham, smiling; &ldquo;number
one is a great favourite with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank is also very obliging!&rdquo; added Lady Harriet; &ldquo;he
would do anything for any body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor fellow! he can&#8217;t help that,&rdquo; said Peter, in a
tone of pity. &ldquo;Some people are born with that sort of desperate
activity&mdash;flying to assist every one&mdash;running up stairs
for whatever is wanted&mdash;searching for whatever is lost&mdash;and
picking up whatever has been dropped. I have seen several
others like Frank, who were troubled with that sort of
turn. He is indulging his own inclination in flying about
everywhere for everybody, as much as I do in sitting still!&mdash;it
is all nature!&mdash;you know tastes differ, for some people
like apples and some like onions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank had a black shade of himself, drawn in uniform
<a name="p0189.png" id="p0189.png" href="#p0189.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">189</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and put into a gilt frame, all for one shilling, which he presented
to his grandmama, who looked sadly at the likeness
when he came smiling into her dressing-room, and calling
Harry to assist in knocking a nail into the wall, that it
might be hung above the chimney-piece. &ldquo;I need nothing
to remind me of you, dear Frank,&rdquo; observed Lady Harriet,
&ldquo;and this is a sad exchange, the shadow for the substance.&rdquo;
Frank gave a handsome new red morocco spectacle-case to
uncle David, and asked leave to carry away the old one with
him as a remembrance. He bought gowns for all the maids,
and books for all the men-servants. He presented Mrs.
Crabtree with an elegant set of tea-cups and saucers, promising
to send her a box of tea the first time he went to
China; and for Laura and Harry he produced a magnificent
magic lanthorn, representing all the stars and planets, which
cost him several guineas. It was exhibited the evening before
Frank went away, and caused great entertainment to a
large party of his companions, who assembled at tea to take
leave of him, on which occasion Peter Grey made a funny
speech, proposing Frank&#8217;s health in a bumper of bohea,
when the whole party became very merry, and did not disperse
till ten.</p>

<p>Major Graham intended accompanying Frank to Portsmouth,
and they were to set off by the mail next evening.
That day was a sad one to Harry and Laura, who were allowed
a whole holiday; but not a sound of merriment was
heard in the house, except when Frank tried to make them
cheerful, by planning what was to be done after he came
back, or when Major Graham invented droll stories about
the adventures Frank would probably meet with at sea.
Even Mrs. Crabtree looked more grave and cross than
usual; and she brought Frank a present of a needle-case
made with her own hands, and filled with thread of every
kind, saying, that she heard all &ldquo;midshipmites&rdquo; learned to
mend their things, and keep them decent, which was an
<a name="p0190.png" id="p0190.png" href="#p0190.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">190</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>excellent custom, and ought to be encouraged; but she hoped
he would remember, that &ldquo;a stitch in time saves nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Harriet stayed most of that day in her dressing-room,
and tried to conceal the traces of many tears when
she did appear; but it was only too evident how sadly her
time had been passed alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmama!&rdquo; said Frank, taking her hand affectionately,
and trying to look cheerful; &ldquo;we shall meet again;
perhaps very soon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Harriet silently laid her hand upon the Bible, to
show that there she found the certain assurance of another
meeting in a better world; but she looked at Frank with
melancholy affection, and added, very solemnly and emphatically,</p>

<div class="poem w18 pl4">
<div class="stanza notopspace">
<div><!-- opening quote absent in original -->&ldquo;&lsquo;There is no union here of hearts,</div>
<div>That finds not here an end.&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="top1">&ldquo;But, grandmama! you are not so very old!&rdquo; exclaimed
Laura, earnestly. &ldquo;Lord Rockville was born ten years
sooner, and besides, young people sometimes die before older
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Laura! young people may die, but old people
must. It is not possible that this feeble aged frame of mine
can long remain in the visible world. &lsquo;The eye of him
that hath seen me shall me no more.&rsquo; I have many more
friends under the earth now, than on it. The streets of this
city would be crowded, if all those I once knew and still remember,
could be revived; but my turn is fast coming, like
theirs, and Frank knows, as all of you do, where it is my
hope and prayer that we may certainly meet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmama!&rdquo; said Frank, in a low and broken voice,
&ldquo;it wants but an hour to the time of my departure; I
should like much if the servants were to come up now for
family prayers and if uncle David would read us the 14th
chapter of St.&nbsp;John.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0191.png" id="p0191.png" href="#p0191.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">191</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>Lady Harriet rung the bell, and before long the whole
household had assembled, as not one would have been absent
on the night of Master Frank&#8217;s departure from home,
which all were deeply grieved at, and even Mrs. Crabtree
dashed a tear from her cheek as she entered the room.</p>

<p>Frank sat with his hand in Lady Harriet&#8217;s, while Major
Graham read the beautiful and comforting chapter which
had been selected, and when the whole family kneeled in
solemn prayer together, many a deep sob, which could not
be conquered, was heard from Frank himself. After all
was over, he approached the servants, and silently shook
hands with each, but could not attempt to speak; after
which Lady Harriet led him to her dressing-room, where
they remained some time, till, the carriage having arrived,
Frank hastened into the drawing-room, clasped Harry and
Laura in his arms, and having, in a voice choked with
grief, bid them both a long farewell, he hurried out of their
presence.</p>

<p>When the door closed, something seemed to fall heavily
on the ground, but this scarcely attracted any one&#8217;s attention,
till Major Graham followed Frank, and was shocked
to find him lying on the staircase perfectly insensible. Instead
of calling for assistance, however, uncle David carefully
lifted Frank in his own arms, and carried him to the
carriage, where, after a few moments, the fresh air, and the
rapid motion revived his recollection, and he burst into
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor grandmama! and Harry and Laura!&rdquo; cried he,
weeping convulsively. &ldquo;Oh! when shall I see them all
again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy!&rdquo; said Major Graham, trying to be cheerful;
&ldquo;do you think nobody ever left home before? One
would suppose you never expected to come back! Three
years seem an age when we look forward, but are nothing
after they have fled. The longer we live, the shorter every
<a name="p0192.png" id="p0192.png" href="#p0192.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">192</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>year appears, and it will seem only the day after to-morrow
when you are rushing into the house again, and all of us
standing at the door to welcome you back. Think what a
joyous moment that will be! There is a wide and wonderful
world for you to see first, and then a happy home afterwards
to revisit.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Yes, dear, good, kind uncle David! no one ever had a
happier home; and till the east comes to the west, I shall
never cease to think of it with gratitude to you and grandmama.
We shall surely all meet again. I must live upon
that prospect. Hope is the jewel that remains wherever we
go, and the hope to which grandmama has directed me, is
truly compared to a rainbow, which not only brightens the
earth, but stretches to heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">Lady Harriet</span> was confined to bed for several days after
Frank&#8217;s departure from home, and during all that week
Harry and Laura felt so melancholy, that even Mrs. Crabtree
became sorry for them, saying it was quite distressing
to see how quiet and good they had become, for Master
Harry was as mild as milk now, and she almost wished he
would be at some of his old tricks again.</p>

<p>On the following Monday, a message arrived from Lady
Rockville, to say that she was going a long drive in her
phaeton, to visit some boys at Musselburgh school, and
would be happy to take Harry and Laura of the party, if
their grandmama had no objection. None being made by
anybody, they flew up stairs to get ready, while Harry did
not take above three steps at a time, and Laura, when she
followed, felt quite astonished to find Mrs. Crabtree looking
almost as pleased as herself, and saying she hoped the expedition
would do them both good.</p>

<p>Before five minutes had elapsed, Harry was mounted on
the dickey, where Lady Rockville desired him to sit,
<a name="p0194.png" id="p0194.png" href="#p0194.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">194</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>instead of the footman, who was now dismissed, as no room
could be made for both; so after that Harry touched his
hat whenever any of the party spoke to him, as if he had
really been the servant.</p>

<p>Laura, meanwhile, was placed between Lady Rockville
and Miss Perceval, where she could hardly keep quiet a
minute for joy, though afraid to turn her head or to stir her
little finger, in case of being thought troublesome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am told that the races take place at Musselburgh to-day,&rdquo;
said Lady Rockville. &ldquo;It is a cruel amusement, derived
from the sufferings of noble animals; they have as
good a right to be happy in the world as ourselves, Laura;
but we shall pass that way, so Harry and you will probably
see the crowds of carriages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how enchanting!&mdash;I never saw a race-course in
my life!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura, springing off her seat with delight.
&ldquo;Harry! Harry! we are going to the races!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurra!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, clapping his hands; &ldquo;what
a delightful surprise! Oh! I am so dreadfully happy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, my dear Lady Rockville,&rdquo; said Miss Perceval,
yawning, &ldquo;what have horses got legs for, except to
run?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not at such a pace! It always shocked me&mdash;formerly
at Doncaster, where the jockeys were sometimes
paid £1000 for winning&mdash;to see how the poor animals were
lashed and spurred along the course, foaming with fatigue,
gasping till they nearly expired. Horses, poor creatures,
from the hour of their birth till their death, have a sad time
of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmama once read me a beautiful description of a
wild horse in his natural state of liberty,&rdquo; said Laura.
<!-- original lacks opening quote -->&ldquo;Among the South American forests he was to be seen carrying
his head erect, with sparkling eyes, flowing mane,
and splendid tail, trotting about among the noble trees, or
<a name="p0195.png" id="p0195.png" href="#p0195.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">195</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>cropping the grass at his feet, looking quite princely, and
doing precisely what he pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then look at the contrast,&rdquo; said Lady Rockville, pointing
to a long row of cart-horses with galled sides, shrivelled
skins, broken knees, and emaciated bodies, which were all
dragging their weary load along. &ldquo;Animals are all meant
for the use of man, but not to be abused, like these poor
creatures!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for racing,&rdquo; said Miss Perceval, &ldquo;a thorough-bred
horse enters into the spirit of it quite as much as his rider.
Did you never hear of Quin&#8217;s celebrated steed, which became
so eager to win, that when his antagonist passed he
seized him violently by the leg, and both jockeys had to
dismount that the furious animal might be torn away. The
famous horse Forester, too, caught hold of his opponent by
the jaw, and could scarcely be disengaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of all the cruel training these poor creatures
went through before they came to that,&rdquo; added Lady Rockville;
&ldquo;of the way in which horses are beaten, spurred,
and severely cut with the whip; then, after their strength
fails, like the well-known &lsquo;high-mettled racer,&rsquo; the poor animal
is probably sold at last to perpetual hard labour and ill-usage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David shewed me yesterday,&rdquo; said Laura, &ldquo;that
horrid picture which you have probably seen, by Cruickshanks,
of the Knackers&#8217; Yards in London, where old
horses are sent to end their miserable days, after it is impossible
to torture them any longer into working. Oh! it
was dreadful! and yet grandmama said the whole sketch
had been taken from life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; answered Lady Rockville. &ldquo;In these
places the wretched animals are literally put to death by
starvation, and may be seen gnawing each other&#8217;s manes in
the last agonies of hunger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Lady Rockville,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Perceval,
<a name="p0196.png" id="p0196.png" href="#p0196.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">196</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>affectedly, &ldquo;how can you talk of such unpleasant things!&mdash;there
is an Act of Parliament against cruelty to animals, so
of course no such thing exists now. Many gentlemen are
vastly kind to old horses, turning them out to grass for years,
that they may enjoy a life of elegant leisure and rural retirement,
to which, no doubt, some are well entitled; for instance,
the famous horse Eclipse, which gained his owner
£25,000! I wish he had been mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But think how many are ruined when one is enriched,
and indeed both are ruined in morals and good feeling;
therefore I am glad that our sex have never yet taken to the
turf. It is bad enough, my dear Miss Perceval, to see that
they have taken to the moors; for were I to say all I think
of those amazons who lately killed their six brace of grouse
on the 12th of August, they would probably challenge me
to single combat. Lord Rockville says, &lsquo;What with gentlemen
doing worsted work, and ladies shouldering double-barrelled
guns, he scarcely thinks this can be the same world
he was born in long ago.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carriage, at this moment, began to proceed along the
road with such extraordinary rapidity, that there seemed no
danger of their following in the dust of any other equipage,
and Miss Perceval became exceedingly alarmed, especially
when Lady Rockville mentioned that this was one of the
first times she had been driven by her new coachman, who
seemed so very unsteady on his seat, she had felt apprehensive,
for some time, that he might be drunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tipsy coachman! Dear Lady Rockville, do let me
out! We shall certainly be killed in this crowd of carriages!
I can walk home! Pray stop him, Miss Laura! I came to
look on at a race, but not to run one myself! This fast driving
is like a railroad, only not quite so straight! I do
verily believe we are run off with! Stop, coachman!&mdash;stop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of all Miss Perceval&rsquo;s exclamations and vociferations,
the carriage flew on with frightful rapidity, though
<a name="p0197.png" id="p0197.png" href="#p0197.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">197</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>it reeled from side to side of the road, as if it had become
intoxicated like the driver himself, who lashed his horses
and galloped along, within an inch of hedges and ditches
all the way, till at last, having reached the race-course, he
pulled up so suddenly and violently, that the horses nearly
fell back on their haunches, while he swore at them in the
most furious and shocking manner.</p>

<p>Lady Rockville now stood up, and spoke to the coachman
very severely on his misconduct, in first driving her
so dangerously fast, and then being disrespectful enough to
use profane language in her presence, adding, that if he did
not conduct himself more properly, she must complain to
Lord Rockville as soon as the carriage returned home.
Upon hearing this, the man looked exceedingly sulky, and
muttered angrily to himself in a tipsy voice, till at last he
suddenly threw away the reins, and, rising from the box, he
began to scramble his way down, nearly falling to the ground
in his haste, and saying, &ldquo;if your ladyship is not pleased
with my driving, you may drive yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this the intoxicated man staggered towards a drinking-booth
not far off, and disappeared, leaving Miss Perceval
perfectly planet-struck with astonishment, and actually
dumb during several minutes with wonder, at all she heard
and saw. There sat Harry, alone on the dicky, behind two
spirited blood-horses, foaming at the mouth with the speed
at which they had come, and ready to start off again at the
slightest hint, while noises on every side were to be heard
enough to frighten a pair of hobby-horses. Piemen ringing
their bells&mdash;blind fiddlers playing out of tune&mdash;boys calling
lists of the horses&mdash;drums beating at the starting-post&mdash;ballad
singers squalling at the full pitch of their voices&mdash;horses
galloping&mdash;grooms quarrelling&mdash;dogs barking&mdash;and children
crying.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this uproar, Harry unexpectedly observed
Captain Digby on horseback not far off. Without losing
<a name="p0198.png" id="p0198.png" href="#p0198.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">198</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>a moment, he stood up, waving his handkerchief, and
calling to beg he would come to the carriage immediately,
as they were in want of assistance; and Lady Rockville
told, as soon as he arrived, though hardly able to help laughing
while she explained it, the extraordinary predicament
they had been placed in. Captain Digby, upon hearing the
story, looked ready to go off like a squib with rage at the
offending coachman, and instantly seizing the driving-whip,
he desired his servant to hold the horses&#8217; heads, while he
proceeded towards the drinking-booth, flourishing the long
lash in his hand as he went in a most ominous manner.
Several minutes elapsed, during which Harry overheard a
prodigious outcry in the tent, and then the drunken coachman
was seen reeling away along the road, while Captain
Digby, still brandishing the whip, returned, and mounting
the dicky himself, he gathered up the reins, and insisted on
driving Lady Rockville&#8217;s phaeton for her. Before long it
was ranged close beside a chariot so full of ladies, it seemed
ready to burst, when Harry was amused to perceive that
Peter Grey and another boy, who were seated on the rumble
behind, had spread a table-cloth on the roof of the carriage,
using it for a dining-table, while they all seemed determined
to astonish their appetites by the quantity of oysters
and sandwiches they ate, and by drinking at the same
time large tumblers of porter. Lady Rockville wished she
could have the loan of Harry and Laura&#8217;s spirits for an hour
or two, when she saw how perfectly bewildered with delight
they were on beholding the thousands of eager persons assembled
on the race-ground,&mdash;jockeys riding about in liveries
as gay as tulips&mdash;officers in scarlet uniform&mdash;red flags
fluttering in the breeze&mdash;caravans exhibiting pictures of the
wildest-looking beasts in the world&mdash;bands of music&mdash;recruiting
parties&mdash;fire-eaters, who dined on red-hot pokers&mdash;portraits
representing pigs fatter than the fattest in the
world&mdash;giants a head and three pair of shoulders taller than
<a name="p0199.png" id="p0199.png" href="#p0199.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">199</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>any one else, and little dwarfs, scarcely visible with the
naked eye&mdash;all of which were shown to children for half
price!</p>

<p>Lady Rockville very good naturedly gave Harry half-a-crown,
promising that, before leaving the race-ground, he
should either buy some oranges to lay the dust in his throat
after so long a drive, or visit as many shows as he pleased
for his half-crown; and they were anxiously discussing
what five sights would be worth sixpence each, when a loud
hurra was heard, the drums beat, and five horses started off
for the first heat. Harry stood up in an ecstacy of delight,
and spoke loudly in admiration of the jockey on a grey
horse, with a pink jacket, who took the lead, and seemed
perfectly to fly, as if he need never touch the ground; but
Harry exclaimed angrily against the next rider, in a yellow
dress and green cap, who pulled back his own bay horse,
as if he really wished to lose. To Laura&#8217;s astonishment,
however, Captain Digby preferred him, and Miss Perceval
declared in favour of a light-blue jacket and chesnut horse.
Harry now thought everybody stupid not to agree with him,
and called out in the height of his eagerness, &ldquo;I would bet
this half-crown upon the pink jacket!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried Peter, laughing. &ldquo;The yellow dress
and green cap for my money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall soon have five shillings!&rdquo; exclaimed
Harry in great glee; but scarcely had he spoken, before a
loud murmuring sound arose among the surrounding
crowd, upon hearing which he looked anxiously about, and
was astonished to see the green cap and yellow dress already
at the winning-post, while his own favourite grey horse
cantered slowly along, far behind all the others, carrying the
jockey in the pink jacket, who hung his head, and was bent
nearly double, with shame and fatigue.</p>

<p>Peter Grey gave a loud laugh of triumph when he glanced
at Harry&#8217;s disappointed angry countenance, and held out
<a name="p0200.png" id="p0200.png" href="#p0200.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">200</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>his hand for the half-crown, saying, &ldquo;Pay your debt of
honour, Master Harry! It is rather fortunate I won, seeing
that not one sixpence had I to have paid you with!
not a penny to jingle on a mile-stone. You had more
money than wit, and I had more wit than money, so we are
well met. Did you not see that the grey horse had fallen
lame? Good-bye, youngster! I shall tell all the giants and
wild beasts to expect you another day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; said Lady Rockville, looking gravely at his
enraged countenance, &ldquo;it is a foolish fish that is caught
with every bait! I am quite relieved that you lost that
money. This is an early lesson against gambling, and no
one can ever be rich or happy who becomes fond of it. We
were wrong to bring you here at all; and I now see you
could easily be led into that dreadful vice, which has caused
misery and ruin to thousands of young men. If you
had possessed an estate, it would have been thrown away
quite as foolishly as the poor half-crown, making you perhaps
miserable afterwards for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought myself quite sure to win!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry,
still looking with angry astonishment after Peter, who was
making odd grimaces, and holding up the half-crown in a
most teazing manner. &ldquo;I would rather have thrown my
money into the sea than given it to Peter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think, too, how many pleasanter and better ways there
are, in which you might have spent it!&rdquo; added Lady Rockville.
&ldquo;Look at that poor blind man whom you could
have relieved, or consider what a nice present you should
have given to Laura! But there seem to be no more
brains in your head, Harry, than in her thimble!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter is quite a little black-leg already,&rdquo; observed Miss
Perceval. &ldquo;I never saw such a boy! So fond of attracting
notice, that he would put on a cap and bells if that would
make him stared at. Last Saturday he undertook for a bet
to make a ceremonious bow to every lamp-post along
<a name="p0201.png" id="p0201.png" href="#p0201.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">201</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Prince&#8217;s Street, and I wish you could have seen the wondering
crowd that gradually collected as he went along, performing
his task with the most perfect composure and
impudence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For cool assurance, I hope there are not many boys
equal to him,&rdquo; said Lady Rockville. &ldquo;He scattered out of
the window lately several red-hot half-pence, among some
beggars, and I am told they perfectly stuck to the poor
creatures&#8217; fingers when trying to pick them up; and he was
sent a message, on his pony, one very cold day lately, to
Lady De Vere&#8217;s, who offered, when he was taking leave, to
cut him one of her finest camellias, to which he replied, &lsquo;I
would much rather you offered me a hot potatoe!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter feels no sympathy in your disappointment, Harry,&rdquo;
added Miss Perceval; &ldquo;but we might as well expect wool
on a dog, as friendship from a gambler, who would ruin his
own father, and always laughs at those who lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and cut your wisdom teeth, Harry!&rdquo; said Captain
Digby, smiling. &ldquo;Any one must have been born blind
not to observe that the grey horse was falling behind; but
you have bought half-a-crown&#8217;s worth of wisdom by experience,
and I hope it will last for life. Never venture to bet
even that your own head is on your shoulders, or it may turn
out a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry is now the monkey that has seen the world, and
I think it will be a whole year of Saturdays before he ever
commits such a blunder again,&rdquo; continued Lady Rockville.
&ldquo;We must for this once, not complain of what has occurred
to Lady Harriet, because she would be exceedingly displeased,
but certainly you are a most ingenious little gentleman
for getting into scrapes!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Harry told upon himself, however, on his return home,
because he had always been accustomed to do so, knowing
Major Graham and his grandmama were never very angry
at any fault that was confessed and repented of, therefore he
<a name="p0202.png" id="p0202.png" href="#p0202.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">202</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>went straight up stairs, and related his whole history to uncle
David, who gave him a very serious exhortation against the
foolish and sinful vice of gambling. To keep him in mind
of his silly adventure that day, Harry was also desired,
during the whole evening, to wear his coat turned inside
out, a very frequent punishment administered by Major
Graham for small offences, and which was generally felt to
be a terrible disgrace.</p>

<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">Some</span> weeks after Frank had left home, while lady Harriet
and Major Graham were absent at Holiday House, Harry
and Laura felt surprised to observe, that Mrs. Crabtree suddenly
became very grave and silent,&mdash;her voice seemed to
have lost half its loudness,&mdash;her countenance looked rather
pale,&mdash;and they both escaped being scolded on several occasions,
when Harry himself could not but think he deserved
it. Once or twice he ventured to do things that at
other times he dared not have attempted, &ldquo;merely as an experiment,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;like that man in the menagerie, who
put his head into the lion&#8217;s mouth, without feeling quite sure
whether it would be bit off the next moment or not;&rdquo; but
though Mrs. Crabtree evidently saw all that passed, she
turned away with a look of sadness, and said not a word.</p>

<p>What could be the matter? Harry almost wished she
would fly into a good passion and scold him, it became so
extraordinary and unnatural to see Mrs. Crabtree sitting all
day in a corner of the room, sewing in silence, and scarcely
looking up from her work; but still the wonder grew, for
<a name="p0204.png" id="p0204.png" href="#p0204.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">204</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>she seemed to become worse and worse every day. Harry
dressed up the cat in an old cap and frock of Laura&#8217;s,&mdash;he
terrified old Jowler by putting him into the shower-bath,&mdash;and
let off a few crackers at the nursery window,&mdash;but it
seemed as if he might have fired a cannon without being
scolded by Mrs. Crabtree, who merely turned her head
round for a minute, and then silently resumed her work.
Laura even fancied that Mrs. Crabtree was once in tears,
but that seemed quite impossible, so she thought no more
about it, till one morning, when they had begun to despair
of ever hearing more about the business, and were whispering
together in a corner of the room, observing that she
looked duller than ever, they were surprised to hear Mrs.
Crabtree calling them both to come near her. She looked
very pale, and was beginning to say something, when her
voice suddenly became so husky and indistinct, that she
seemed unable to proceed; therefore, motioning with her
hand for them to go away, she began sewing very rapidly,
as she had done before, breaking her threads, and pricking
her fingers, at every stitch.</p>

<p>Laura and Harry silently looked at each other with some
apprehension, and the nursery now became so perfectly still,
that a feather falling on the ground would have been heard.
This had continued for some time, when at last Laura upon
tiptoe stole quietly up to where Mrs. Crabtree was sitting,
and said to her, in a very kind and anxious voice, &ldquo;I am
afraid you are not well, Mrs. Crabtree! Grandmama will
send for a doctor when she comes home. Shall I ask
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, Miss Laura!&mdash;never mind me!
Your grandmama knows what is the matter. It will be
all one a hundred years hence,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Crabtree,
in a low husky voice. &ldquo;This is a thing you will be
very glad to hear!&mdash;you must prepare to be told some good
news!&rdquo; added she, forcing a laugh, but such a laugh as
<a name="p0205.png" id="p0205.png" href="#p0205.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">205</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Harry and Laura never heard before, for it sounded so
much more like sorrow than joy. They waited in great
suspense to hear what would follow, but Mrs. Crabtree, after
struggling to speak again with composure, suddenly
started off her seat, and hurried rapidly out of the room.
She appeared no more in the nursery that day, but next
morning when they were at breakfast, she entered the room
with her face very much covered up in her bonnet, and
evidently tried to speak in her usual loud bustling voice,
though somehow it still sounded perfectly different from
common. &ldquo;Well, children! Lady Harriet was so kind as
to promise that my secret should be kept till I pleased, and
that no one should mention it to you but myself. I am going
away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, looking earnestly in Mrs.
Crabtree&#8217;s face. &ldquo;Are you going away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Master Harry,&mdash;I leave this house to-day! Now,
don&#8217;t pretend to look sorry! I know you are not! I can&#8217;t
bear children to tell stories. Who would ever be sorry for
a cross old woman like me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But perhaps I am sorry! Are you in real earnest going
away?&rdquo; asked Harry again, with renewed astonishment.
&ldquo;Oh<!-- original reads "On" --> no! it is only a joke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I look as if this were a joke?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Crabtree,
turning round her face, which was bathed with tears.
&ldquo;No, no! I am come to bid you both a long farewell. A
fine mess you will get into now! All your things going to
rack and ruin, with nobody fit to look after them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mrs. Crabtree! we do not like you to go away,&rdquo;<!-- original has closing single quote -->
said Laura, kindly. &ldquo;Why are you leaving us all on a
sudden? it is very odd! I never was so surprised in my
life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your papa&#8217;s orders are come. He wrote me a line
some weeks ago, to say that I have been too severe. Perhaps
that is all true. I meant it well, and we are poor
<a name="p0206.png" id="p0206.png" href="#p0206.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">206</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>creatures, who can only act for the best. However, it can&#8217;t
be helped now! There&#8217;s no use in lamenting over spilt
cream. You&#8217;ll be the better behaved afterwards. If ever you
think of me again, children, let it be as kindly as possible.
Many and many a time I shall remember you both. I
never cared for any young people but yourselves, and I
shall never take charge of any others. Master Frank was
the best boy in the world, and you would both have been as
good under my care,&mdash;but it is no matter now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it does matter a very great deal,&rdquo; cried Harry,
eagerly. &ldquo;You must stay here, Mrs. Crabtree, as long as
you live, and a great deal longer! I shall write a letter to
papa all about it. We were very troublesome, and it was
our own faults if we were punished. Never mind, Mrs.
Crabtree, but take off your bonnet and sit down! I am
going to do some dreadful mischief to-night, so you will be
wanted to keep me in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Crabtree laid her hand upon Harry&#8217;s head in silence,
and there was something so solemn and serious in
her manner, that he saw it would be useless to remonstrate
any more. She then held out her hand to Laura, endeavouring
to smile as she did so, but it was a vain attempt, for
her lip quivered, and she turned away, saying, &ldquo;Who
would ever believe I should make such a fool of myself!
Farewell to you both! and let nobody speak ill of me after
I am gone, if you can help it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without looking round, Mrs. Crabtree hurried out of the
nursery and closed the door, leaving Harry and Laura perfectly
bewildered with astonishment at this sudden event,
which seemed more like a dream than a reality. They both
felt exceedingly melancholy, hardly able to believe that she
had formerly been at all cross, while they stood at the window
with tears in their eyes, watching the departure of her
well-known blue chest, on a wheel-barrow, and taking a
<a name="p0207.png" id="p0207.png" href="#p0207.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">207</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>last look of her red gown and scarlet shawl as she hastily
followed it.</p>

<p>For several weeks to come, whenever the door opened,
Harry and Laura almost expected her to enter, but month
after month elapsed, and Mrs. Crabtree appeared no more,
till one day, at their earnest entreaty, Lady Harriet took
them a drive of some miles into the country, to see the neat
little lodging by the sea-side where she lived, and maintained
herself by sewing, and by going out occasionally as
a sick-nurse. A more delightful surprise certainly never
could have been given than when Harry and Laura tapped
at the cottage door, which was opened by Mrs. Crabtree herself,
who started back with an exclamation of joyful amazement,
and looked as if she could scarcely believe her eyes on
beholding them, while they laughed at the joke till tears were
running down their cheeks. &ldquo;Is Mrs. Crabtree at home?&rdquo;
said Harry, trying to look very grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmama says we may stay here for an hour, while
she drives along the shore,&rdquo; added Laura, stepping into the
house with a very merry face. &ldquo;And how do you do, Mrs.
Crabtree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Laura, and very happy to see you.
What a tall girl you are become! and Master Harry too!
looking quite over his own shoulders!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After sitting some time, Mrs. Crabtree insisted on their
having some dinner in her cottage; so making Harry and
Laura sit down on each side of a large blazing fire, she
cooked some most delicious pancakes for them in rapid
succession, as fast as they could eat, tossing them high in
the air first, and then rolling up each as it was fried, with a
large spoonful of jam in the centre, till Harry and Laura at
last said, that unless Mrs. Crabtree supplied fresh appetites,
she need make no more pancakes, for they thought even
Peter Grey himself could scarcely have finished all she provided.</p>

<p><a name="p0208.png" id="p0208.png" href="#p0208.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">208</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>Harry had now been several months constantly attending
school, where he became a great favourite with the boys,
and a great torment to the masters, while, for his own part,
he liked it twenty times better than he had expected, because
the lessons were tolerably easy to a clever boy, as he really
was, and the games at cricket and foot-ball in the play-ground
put him perfectly wild with joy. Every boy at
school seemed to be his particular friend, and many called
him &ldquo;the holiday-maker,&rdquo; because, if ever a holiday was
wished for, Harry always became leader in the scheme.
The last morning of Peter Grey&#8217;s appearing at school,
he got the name of &ldquo;the copper captain,&rdquo; because Mr.
Lexicon having fined him half-a-crown, for not knowing
one of his lessons, he brought the whole sum in half-pence,
carrying them in his hat, and gravely counting them all out,
with such a pains-taking, good-boy look, that any one, to
see him, would have supposed he was quite penitent and
sorry for his misconduct; but no sooner had he finished the
task and ranged all the half-pence neatly in rows along Mr.
Lexicon&#8217;s desk, than he was desired, in a voice of thunder,
to leave the room instantly, and never to return, which
accordingly he never did, having started next day on the
top of the coach for Portsmouth, and the last peep Harry got
of him, he was buying a perfect mountain of gingerbread
out of an old man&#8217;s basket, to eat by the way.</p>

<p>Meantime Laura had lessons from a regular day-governess,
who came every morning at seven, and never disappeared
till four in the afternoon, so, as Mrs. Crabtree remarked,
&ldquo;the puir thing was perfectly deaved wi&#8217; edication,&rdquo; but
she made such rapid progress, that uncle David said it would
be difficult to decide whether she was growing fastest in
body or in mind. Laura seemed born to be under the tuition
of none but ill-tempered people, and Madame Pirouette appeared
in a constant state of irritability. During the music-lessons,
she sat close to the piano, with a pair of sharp-pointed
<a name="p0209.png" id="p0209.png" href="#p0209.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">209</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>scissors in her hand, and whenever Laura played a
wrong note, she stuck their points into the offending finger,
saying sometimes in an angry foreign accent, &ldquo;put your
toe upon &#8217;dis note! I tell you, put your toe upon &#8217;dis note!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My finger, I suppose you mean?&rdquo; asked Laura, trying
not to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! fingare and toe! dat is all one! Speak not a
word! take hold of your tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura!&rdquo; said Major Graham, one day, &ldquo;I would as
soon hear a gong sounded at my ear for half an hour, as
most of the fine pieces you perform now. Taste and expression
are quite out of date, but the chief object of ambition
is, to seem as if you had four hands instead of two, from
the torrent of notes produced at once. If ever you wish to
please my old-fashioned ears, give me melody,&mdash;something
that touches the heart and dwells in the memory,&mdash;then
years afterwards, when we hear it again, the language seems
familiar to our feelings, and we listen with deep delight to
sounds recalling a thousand recollections of former days,
which are brought back by music (real music) with distinctness
and interest which nothing else can equal.&rdquo;<!-- original lacks closing quote --></p>

<p>During more than two years, while Harry and Laura
were rapidly advancing in education, they received many
interesting letters from Frank, expressing the most affectionate
anxiety to hear of their being well and happy, while
his paper was filled with amusing accounts of the various
wonderful countries he visited; and at the bottom of the
paper, he always very kindly remembered to send them an
order on his banker, as he called uncle David, drawn up in
proper form, saying, &ldquo;Please to pay Master Harry and Miss
Laura Graham the sum of five shillings on my account.
<span class="sc">Francis Arthur Graham</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Frank&#8217;s gay, merry epistles, he kept all his little annoyances
or vexations to himself, and invariably took up
the pen with such a desire to send cheerfulness into his own
<a name="p0210.png" id="p0210.png" href="#p0210.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">210</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>beloved home, that his letters might have been written with
a sun-beam, they were so full of warmth and vivacity. It
seemed always a fair wind to Frank, for he looked upon the
best side of every thing, and never teazed his absent friends
with complaints of distresses they could not remedy, except
when he frequently mentioned his sorrow at being separated
from them, adding, that he often wished it were possible to
meet them during one day in every year, to tell all his
thoughts, and to hear theirs in return, for sometimes now,
during the night watches, when all other resources failed,
he entertained himself, by imagining the circle of home all
gathered around him, and by inventing what each individual
would say upon any subjects he liked, while all his adventures
acquired a double interest, from considering that the
recital would one day amuse his dear friends when their
happy meeting at last took place. Frank was not so over-anxious
about his own comfort, as to feel very much irritated
and discomposed at any privations that fell in his
way, and once sitting up in the middle of a dark night,
with the rain pouring in torrents, and the wind blowing a
perfect hurricane, he drew his watch-coat round him, saying
good humouredly to his grumbling companions, &ldquo;This
is by no means so bad! and whatever change takes place
now, will probably be for the better. Sunshine is as sure
to come as Christmas, if you only wait for it, and in the
meantime we are all more comfortably off than St. Patrick,
when he had to swim across a stormy sea, with his head
under his arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Frank often amused his messmates with stories which he
had heard from uncle David, and soon became the greatest
favourite imaginable with them all, while he frequently endeavoured
to lead their minds to the same sure foundation
of happiness which he always found the best security of his
own. He had long been taught to know that a vessel might
as well be steered without rudder or compass, as any
<a name="p0211.png" id="p0211.png" href="#p0211.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">211</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>individual be brought into a haven of peace, unless directed by
the Holy Scriptures; and his delight was frequently to study
such passages as these: &ldquo;When thou passest through the
waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they
shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire,
thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle
upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of
Israel, thy Saviour.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">As</span> Harry and Laura grew older, they were gradually treated
like friends and companions by Lady Harriet and Major
Graham, who improved their minds by frequent interesting
conversations, in which knowledge and principle
were insensibly instilled into their minds, not by formal instruction,
but merely by mentioning facts, or expressing
opinions and sentiments such as naturally arose out
of the subjects under discussion, and accustoming the
young people themselves to feel certain that their own
remarks and thoughts were to be heard with the same interest
as those of any other person. No surprise was expressed,
if they appeared more acute or more amusing than
might have been expected,&mdash;no angry contempt betrayed itself
if they spoke foolishly, unless it were something positively
wrong; and thus Major Graham and Lady Harriet
succeeded in making that very difficult transition from treating
children as toys, to becoming their confidential friends,
<a name="p0213.png" id="p0213.png" href="#p0213.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">213</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and most trusted, as well as most respected and beloved associates.</p>

<p>Frank had been upwards of five years cruizing on various
stations abroad, and many officers who had seen him,
gave such agreeable reports to Major Graham of his admirable
conduct on several occasions, and of his having turned
out so extremely handsome and pleasing, that Lady Harriet
often wished, with tears in her eyes, it were possible she
might live to see him once again, though her own daily increasing
infirmities rendered that hope every hour more improbable.
She was told that he spoke of her very frequently,
and said once when he met an aged person at the Cape,
&ldquo;I would give all I possess on earth, and ten times more,
if I had it, to see my dear grandmother as well, and to meet
her once more.&rdquo; This deeply affected Lady Harriet,
who was speaking one day with unusual earnestness of the
comfort it gave, whatever might be the will of Providence
in respect to herself, that Frank seemed so happy, and liked
his profession so well, when the door flew open, and Andrew
hastened into the room, his old face perfectly wrinkled
with delight, while he displayed a letter in his hand, saying
in a tone of breathless agitation, as he delivered it to Major
Graham, &ldquo;The post-mark is Portsmouth, Sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Harriet nearly rose from her seat with an exclamation
of joy, but unable for the exertion, she sunk back, covering
her face with her hands, and listening in speechless
suspense to hear whether Frank had indeed returned. Harry
and Laura eagerly looked over Major Graham&#8217;s shoulder,
and Andrew lingered anxiously at the door, till this welcome
letter was hurriedly torn open and read. The direction was
certainly Frank&#8217;s writing, though it seemed very different
from usual, but the contents filled Major Graham with a degree
of consternation and alarm, which he vainly endeavoured
to conceal, for it informed him that, during a desperate
engagement with some slave-ships off the coast of Africa,
<a name="p0214.png" id="p0214.png" href="#p0214.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">214</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Frank had been most severely wounded, from which he
scarcely recovered before a violent attack of fever reduced
him so extremely, that the doctors declared his only chance
of restoration was to be invalided home immediately;
&ldquo;therefore,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;you must all unite a prayer for my
recovery, with a thanksgiving for my return, and I can
scarcely regret an illness that restores me to home. My
heart is already with you all, but my frail shattered body
must rest some days in London, as the voyage from Sierra
Leone has been extremely fatiguing and tedious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Harriet made not a single remark when this letter
was closed, but tears coursed each other rapidly down
her aged cheeks, while she slowly removed her hands from
her face, and gazed at Major Graham, who seated himself by
her side, in evident agitation, and calling back Andrew when
he was leaving the room, he said, in accents of unusual
emotion, &ldquo;Desire John to inquire immediately whether any
steam-boat sails for London to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right!&rdquo; said Lady Harriet, feebly. &ldquo;Oh! that
I could accompany you! But bring him to me if possible.
I dare not hope to go. Surely we shall meet at last. Now
indeed I feel my own weakness, when I cannot fly to see
him. But he will be quite able for the journey. Frank
had an excellent constitution,&mdash;he&mdash;he <span class="nw">was&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Lady Harriet&#8217;s voice failed, and she burst into a convulsive
agony of tears.</p>

<p>A few hours, and uncle David had embarked for London,
where, after a short passage, he arrived at his usual lodgings
in St. James&#8217; Place; but some days elapsed, during which
he laboured in vain to discover the smallest trace of Frank,
who had omitted, in his hurried letter from Portsmouth, to
mention where he intended living in town. One evening,
fatigued with his long and unavailing search, Major Graham
sat down, at the British Coffee-house, to take some refreshment
before resuming his inquiries, and was afterwards
<a name="p0215.png" id="p0215.png" href="#p0215.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">215</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>about to leave the room, when he observed a very tall interesting
young man, exceedingly emaciated, who strolled languidly
into the room, with so feeble a step, that he scarcely
seemed able to support himself. The stranger took off his
hat, sunk into a seat, and passed his fingers through the
dark masses of curls that hung over his pale white forehead,
his large eyes closed heavily with fatigue, his cheek assumed
a hectic glow, and his head sunk upon his hand. In a low
subdued voice he gave some directions to the waiter, and
Major Graham, after gazing for a moment with melancholy
interest at this apparently consumptive youth, was about to
depart, when a turn of the young man&#8217;s countenance caused
him to start; he looked again more earnestly&mdash;every fibre
of his frame seemed suddenly to thrill with apprehension,
and at last, in a voice of doubt and astonishment, he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Frank!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger sprung from his seat, gazed eagerly round
the room, rushed into the arms of Major Graham, and
fainted.</p>

<p>Long and anxiously did uncle David watch for the restoration
of Frank, while every means were used to revive
him, and when at length he did regain his consciousness,
no time was lost in conveying him to St. James&#8217; Place,
where, after being confined to bed, and attended by Sir Astley
Cooper and Sir Henry Halford, during some days, they
united in recommending that he should be carried some
miles out of town, to the neighbourhood of Hammersmith,
for change of air, till the effect of medicine and diet could
be fully tried. Frank earnestly entreated that he might be
taken immediately to his own home, but this the doctors
pronounced quite impossible, privately hinting to Major
Graham that it seemed very doubtful indeed whether he
could ever be moved there at all, or whether he might survive
above a few months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home is anywhere that my own family live with me,&rdquo;
<a name="p0216.png" id="p0216.png" href="#p0216.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">216</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>said Frank in a tone of resignation, when he heard a journey
to Scotland pronounced impossible. &ldquo;It is not where
I am, but who I see, that signifies; and this meeting with
you, uncle David, did me more good than an ocean of
physic. Oh! if I could only converse with grandmama
for half-an-hour, and speak to dear Harry and Laura, it
would be too much happiness. I want to see how much
they are both grown, and to hear their merry laugh again.
Perhaps I never may! But if I get worse, they must come
here. I have many things to say! Why should they not
set off now?&mdash;immediately! If I recover, we might be
such a happy party to Scotland again. For grandmama, I
know it is impossible; but will you write and ask her about
Harry and Laura? The sooner the better, uncle David,
because I often think it <span class="nw">probable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Frank coloured and hesitated; he looked earnestly at his
uncle for some moments, who saw what was meant, and
then added,</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one person more, far distant, and little thinking
of what is to come, who must be told. You have
always been a father to me, uncle David, but he also would
wish to be here now. Little as we have been together, I
know how much he loves me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank&#8217;s request became no sooner known than it was
complied with by Lady Harriet, who thought it better not
to distress Harry and Laura, by mentioning the full extent
of his danger, but merely said, that he felt impatient for the
meeting, and that they might prepare on the following day,
to embark under charge of old Andrew and her own maid
Harrison, for a voyage to London, where she hoped they
would find the dear invalid already better; Laura was astonished
at the agitation with which she spoke, and felt bewildered
and amazed by this sudden announcement. She
and Harry had once or twice in their lives caught cold, and
spent a day in bed, confined to a diet of gruel and syrup,
<a name="p0217.png" id="p0217.png" href="#p0217.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">217</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>which always proved an infallible remedy for the very worst
attacks, and they had frequently witnessed the severe sufferings
of their grandmama, from which, however, she always
recovered, and which seemed to them the natural effects of
her extreme old age; but to imagine the possibility of
Frank&#8217;s life being in actual danger, never crossed their
thoughts for an instant, and, therefore, it was with a feeling
of unutterable joy that they stood on the deck of the Royal
Pandemonium, knowing that they were now actually going
to meet Frank.</p>

<p>Nothing could be a greater novelty to both the young
travellers than the scene by which they were now surrounded;
trumpets were sounding&mdash;bells ringing&mdash;children crying&mdash;sailors,
passengers, carriages, dogs, and baggage all
hurrying on board pell-mell, while a jet of steam came bellowing
forth from the waste-pipe, as if it were struggling to
get rid of the huge column of black smoke vomited forth
by the chimney. Below stairs they were still more astonished
to find a large cabin, covered with gilding, red damask,
and mirrors, where crowds of strange-looking people,
more than half sick, and very cross, were scolding and
bustling about, bawling for their carpet bags, and trying to
be of as much consequence as possible, while they ate and
drank trash, to keep off sea-sickness, that might have made
any one sick on shore&mdash;sipping brandy and water, or eating
peppermint drops, according as the case required. Among
those in the ladies&#8217; cabin, Laura and Harry were amused to
discover Miss Perceval, who had hastened into bed already,
in case of being ill, and was talking unceasingly to any
one who would listen, besides ordering and scolding a poor
sick maid, scarcely able to stand. Her head was enveloped
in a most singular night-cap, ornamented with old ribbons
and artificial flowers&mdash;she wore a bright yellow shawl, and
had taken into the berth beside her, a little Blenheim spaniel&mdash;a
parrot&mdash;and a cage of canary birds, the noisy
<a name="p0218.png" id="p0218.png" href="#p0218.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">218</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>inhabitants of which sung at the full pitch of their voices till the
very latest hour of the night, being kept awake by the lamp
which swung from side to side, while nothing could be compared
to their volubility except the perpetual clamour occasioned
by Miss Perceval herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare these little narrow beds are no better than
coffins! I never saw such places! and the smell is like
singed blankets and cabbages boiled in melted oil! It is
enough to make anybody ill! Mary! go and fetch me a cup
of tea, and, do you hear! tell those people on deck not to
make such a noise&mdash;it gives me a headache! Be sure you
say that I shall complain to the Captain. Reach me some
bread and milk for the parrot,&mdash;fetch my smelling bottle,&mdash;go
to the saloon for that book I was reading,&mdash;and search
again for the pocket-handkerchief I mislaid. It cost ten
guineas, and must be found. I hope no one has stolen it!
Now do make haste with the tea! What are you dawdling
there for? If you do not stop that noise on deck, Mary, I
shall be exceedingly displeased! Some of those horrid people
in the steerage were smoking too, but tell the Captain
that if I come up he must forbid them. It is a trick to
make us all sick and save provisions. I observed a gun-case
in the saloon too, which is a most dangerous thing, for
guns always go off when you least expect. If any one fires,
I shall fall into hysterics. I shall, indeed! What a creaking
noise the vessel makes! I hope there is no danger of
its splitting! We ought not to go on sailing after dusk.
The Captain must positively cast anchor during the night,
that we may have no more of this noise or motion, but sleep
in peace and quietness till morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon after the Royal Pandemonium had set sail, or rather
set fire, the wind freshened, and the pitching of the vessel
became so rough, that Harry and Laura, with great difficulty,
staggered to seats on the deck, leaving both Lady Harriet&#8217;s
servants so very sick below, that instead of being able
<a name="p0219.png" id="p0219.png" href="#p0219.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">219</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>to attend on them, they gave nine times the trouble that any
other passenger did on board, and were not visible again
during the whole voyage. The two young travellers now
sat down together, and watched, with great curiosity, several
groups of strangers on deck: ladies, half sick, trying to
entertain gentlemen in seal-skin travelling caps and pale
cadaverous countenances, smoking cigars; others opening
baskets of provisions, and eating with good sea-faring appetite;
while one party had a carriage on the deck so filled
with luxuries of every kind, that there seemed no end to
the multitude of Perigord pies, German sausages, cold
fowls, pastry, and fruit that were produced during the evening.
The owners had a table spread on the deck, and ate
voraciously, before a circle of hungry spectators, which had
such an appearance of selfishness and gluttony, that both
his young friends thought immediately of Peter Grey.</p>

<p>As evening closed in, Harry and Laura began to feel
very desolate thus for the first time in their lives alone,
while the wide waste of waters around made the scene yet
more forlorn. They had enjoyed unmingled delight in
talking over and over about their happy meeting with Frank,
and planned a hundred times how joyfully they would rush into
the house, and with what pleasure they would relate all that happened
to themselves, after hearing from his own mouth the
extraordinary adventures which his letters had described.
Laura produced from her reticule several of the last she had
received, and laughed again over the funny jokes and stories
they contained, inventing many new questions to ask him
on the subject, and fancying she already heard his voice,
and saw his bright and joyous countenance. But now the
night had grown so dark and chilly, that both Harry and
Laura felt themselves gradually becoming cold, melancholy,
and dejected. They made an effort to walk arm-in-arm up
and down the deck, in imitation of the few other passengers
who had been able to remain out of bed, and they tried
<a name="p0220.png" id="p0220.png" href="#p0220.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">220</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>still to talk cheerfully, but in spite of every effort, their
thoughts became mournful. After clinging together for
some time, and staggering up and down, without feeling
in spirits to speak, they were still shiveringly cold, yet unwilling
to separate for the night, when Harry suddenly stood
still, grasping Laura&#8217;s arm with a look of startled astonishment,
which caused her hastily to glance round in the direction
where he was eagerly gazing, but nothing became
visible except the dim outline of a woman&#8217;s figure, rolled
up in several enormous shawls, and with her bonnet
slouched far over her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certain it was her!&rdquo; whispered Harry, in a tone
of breathless amazement; &ldquo;almost certain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Laura, eagerly.</p>

<p>Without answering, Harry sprung forward, and seized
the unknown person by the arm, who instantly looked
round.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="sc">It was Mrs. Crabtree!</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you observed me, Master Harry! I did
not intend to trouble you and Miss Laura during the
voyage,&rdquo; said she, turning her face slowly towards him,
when, to his surprise, he saw that the traces of tears were
on her cheek, and her manner appeared so subdued, and altogether
so different from former times, that Laura could
scarcely yet credit her senses. &ldquo;I shall not be at all in
your way, children, but I &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; I must see Master
Frank again. He was always too good for this world, and
he&#8217;ll not be here long&mdash;Andrew told me all about it, and I
could not stay behind. I wish we were all as well prepared,
and then the sooner we die the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura listened in speechless consternation to
these words. The very idea of losing Frank had never
before crossed their imaginations for a moment, and they
could have wished to believe that what Mrs. Crabtree said
was like the ravings of delirium, yet an irresistible feeling
of awe and alarm rushed into their minds.</p>

<p><a name="p0221.png" id="p0221.png" href="#p0221.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">221</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Miss Laura! if you want any help in undressing, call
to me at any time. I was sure that doited body Harrison
could be of no service. She never was fit to take care of
herself, and far less of such as you. It put me wild to think
of your coming all this way with nobody fit to look after
you, and then the distress that must follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely, Mrs. Crabtree, you do not think Frank so
very ill,&rdquo; asked Laura, making an effort to recover her
voice, and speaking in a tone of deep anxiety; &ldquo;he had
recovered from the fever, but is only rather too weak for travelling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Laura! grief always comes too soon, and I
would have held my tongue had I thought you did not know
the worst already. If I might order as in former days, it
would be to send you both down directly, out of this heavy
fog and cold wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you may order us, Mrs. Crabtree,&rdquo; said Harry,
taking her kindly by the hand; &ldquo;we are very glad to see
you again! and I shall do whatever you bid me! So you
came all this way on purpose for us! How very kind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Harry, I would go round the wide world to
serve any one of you! who else have I to care for? But it
was chiefly to see Master Frank. Let us hope the best,
and pray to be prepared for any event that may come. All
things are ordained for good, and we can only make the
best of what happens. The world must go round,&mdash;it must
go round, and we can&#8217;t prevent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura hung their heads in dismay, for there
was something agitated and solemn in Mrs. Crabtree&#8217;s
manner, which astonished and shocked them, so they hurried
silently to bed; and Laura&#8217;s pillow was drenched with
tears of anxiety and distress that night, though gradually, as
she thought of Frank&#8217;s bright colour and sparkling eyes, his
joyous spirits and unbroken health, it seemed impossible
that all were so soon to fade away, that the wind should
<a name="p0222.png" id="p0222.png" href="#p0222.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">222</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>have already passed over them, and they were gone, till by
degrees her mind became more calm; her hopes grew into
certainties; she told herself twenty times over, that Mrs.
Crabtree must be entirely mistaken, and at last sunk into a
restless agitated slumber.</p>

<p>Next day the sun shone, the sky was clear, and every
thing appeared so full of life and joy, that Harry and Laura
would have fancied the whole scene with Mrs. Crabtree a
distressing dream, had they not been awakened to recollection
before six in the morning, by the sound of her voice,
angrily rebuking Miss Perceval and other ladies, who with
too good reason, were grumbling at the hardship of sleeping,
or rather vainly attempting to sleep, in such narrow uncomfortable
dog-holes. Laura heard Mrs. Crabtree conclude
an eloquent oration on the subject of contentment, by saying,
&ldquo;Indeed, ladies! many a brave man, and noblemen&#8217;s
sons too, have laid their heads on the green grass, fighting
for you, so we should put up with a hard bed patiently for
one night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Perceval turned angrily away, and summoned her
maid to receive a multitude of new directions. &ldquo;Mary, tell
the Captain that when I looked out last, there was scarcely
any smoke coming out of the funnel, so I am sure he is
saving fuel, and not keeping good enough fires to carry us
on! I never knew such shabbiness! Tell the engineer,
that I insist on his throwing on more coals immediately.
Bring me some hot water, as fast as possible! These
towels are so coarse, I cannot, on any account, use them.
After being accustomed to such pocket-handkerchiefs as
mine, at ten guineas each, one does become particular.
Can you not find a larger basin? This looks like a soup-plate,
and it seems impossible here to get enough of hot
water to wash comfortably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She should be put into the boiler of the steam-boat,&rdquo; muttered
Mrs. Crabtree. &ldquo;I wish them animal-magnifying
<a name="p0223.png" id="p0223.png" href="#p0223.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">223</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>doctors would put the young lady to sleep till we arrive in
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; continued Miss Perceval, &ldquo;get me another
cup of tea. The last was too sweet, the one before not
strong enough, and the first half cold, but this is worse than
any. Do remember to mention, that yesterday night the
steward sent up a tin tea-pot, a thing I cannot possibly suffer
again. We must have the urn, too, instead of that
black tea-kettle; and desire him to prepare some butter-toast&mdash;I
am not hungry, so three rounds will be enough.
Let me have some green tea this time; and see that the
cream is better than last night, when I am certain it was
thickened with chalk or snails. The jelly, too, was execrable,
for it tasted like sticking-plaster&mdash;I shall starve if better
can&#8217;t be had; and the table-cloth looked like a pair of
old sheets. Tell the steward all this, and say, he must get
my breakfast ready on deck in half an hour; but meantime,
I shall sit here with a book while you brush my hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sick persecuted maid seemed anxious to do all she
was bid; so, after delivering as many of the messages as
possible, she tried to stand up and do Miss Perceval&#8217;s hair,
but the motion of the vessel had greatly increased, and she
turned as pale as death, apparently on the point of sinking
to the ground, when Laura, now quite dressed, quietly
slipped the brush out of her hand, and carefully brushed
Miss Perceval&#8217;s thin locks, while poor Mary silently dropped
upon a seat, being perfectly faint with sickness.</p>

<p>Miss Perceval read on, without observing the change of
abigails, till Harry, who had watched this whole scene from
the cabin-door, made a hissing noise, such as grooms do
when they currycomb a horse, which caused the young
lady to look hastily round, when great was Miss Perceval&#8217;s
astonishment to discover her new abigail, with a very pains-taking
look, brushing her hair, while poor Mary lay more
dead than alive on the benches. &ldquo;Well! I declare! was
<a name="p0224.png" id="p0224.png" href="#p0224.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">224</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>there ever anything so odd!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a voice of
amazement. &ldquo;How very strange! What can be the matter
with Mary! There is no end to the plague of servants!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or rather to the plague of mistresses!&rdquo; thought Laura,
while she glanced from Miss Perceval&#8217;s round, red bustling
face, to the poor suffering maid, who became worse and
worse during the day, for there came on what sailors call &ldquo;a
capful of wind,&rdquo; which gradually rose to a &ldquo;stiff breeze,&rdquo; or,
what the passengers considered a hurricane; and, towards
night, it attained the dignity of a real undeniable &ldquo;storm.&rdquo;
A scene of indescribable tumult then ensued. The Captain
attempted to make his voice heard above the roaring
tempest, using a torrent of unintelligible nautical phrases,
and an incessant volley of very intelligible oaths. The sailors
flew about, and every plank in the vessel seemed creaking
and straining, but high above all, the shrill tones of
Miss Perceval were audibly heard, exclaiming,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there enough of &lsquo;hands&rsquo; on board? Is there any
danger? Are you sure the boiler will not burst? I wish
steam-boats had never been invented! People are sure to
be blown up to the clouds, or sunk to the bottom of the
ocean, or scalded to death like so many lobsters. I cannot
stand this any longer! Stop the ship, and set me on shore
instantly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura clung closer to Harry, and felt that they were like
two mere pigmies, amid the wide waste of waters, rolling
and tossing around them, while his spirits, on the contrary,
rose to the highest pitch of excitement with all he heard and
saw, till at length, wishing to enjoy more of the &ldquo;fun,&rdquo; he
determined to venture above board. By the time Harry&#8217;s
nose was on a level with the deck, he gazed around, and
saw that not a person appeared visible except two sailors,
both lashed to the helm, while all was silent now, except the
deafening noise made by the wild waves and the stormy
blast, which seemed as if it would blow his teeth down his
<a name="p0225.png" id="p0225.png" href="#p0225.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">225</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>throat. Harry thought the two men looked no larger than
mice in such a scene, and stood, clinging to the bannisters,
perfectly entranced with astonishment and admiration at the
novelty of all he saw, and thinking how often Frank
must have been in such scenes, when suddenly a wave
washed quite over the deck, and he felt his arm grasped by
Mrs. Crabtree, who desired him to come down immediately,
in a tone of authority which he did not even yet feel bold
enough to disobey; therefore, slowly and reluctantly he descended
to the cabin, where the only living thing that seemed
well enough to move, was Miss Perceval&#8217;s tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steward!&rdquo; she cried, in sharp angry accents. &ldquo;Steward!
here is water pouring down the sky-lights like a shower-bath!
Look at my band-box swimming on the floor!
Mary! Tiresome creature! don&#8217;t you see that? My best
bonnet will be destroyed! Send the Captain here! He
must positively stop that noise on deck; it is quite intolerable.
My head aches, as if it would burst like the boiler of
a steam-boat! Stupid man! Can&#8217;t he put into some port,
or cast anchor? How can he keep us all uncomfortable in
this way! Mary! Mary, I say! are you deaf? Steward!
send one of the sailors here to take care of this dog! I
declare poor Frisk is going to be sick! Mary! Mary! This
is insufferable! I wish the Captain would come and help
me to scold my maid! I shall certainly give you warning,
Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This awful threat had but little effect on one who thought
herself on the brink of being buried beneath the waves,
besides being too sick to care whether she died the next
minute or not; and even Miss Perceval&#8217;s voice became
drowned at last in the tremendous storm which raged
throughout the night, during which the Captain rather increased
Laura&#8217;s panic, if that were possible, by considerately
putting his head into the cabin now and then to say,
&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be afraid, ladies! There is no danger!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0226.png" id="p0226.png" href="#p0226.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">226</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;But I must come up and see what you are about, Captain!&rdquo;
exclaimed Miss Perceval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better be still, ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Crabtree.
&ldquo;It is as well to be drowned in bed as on deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing gives a more awful idea of the helplessness of
man, and the wrath of God, than a tempestuous sea during
the gloom of midnight; and every mind on board became
awed into silence and solemnity during this war of elements,
till at length, towards morning, while the hurricane
seemed yet raging with undiminished fury, Laura suddenly
gave an exclamation of rapture, on hearing a sailor at the
helm begin to sing Tom Bowling. &ldquo;Now I feel sure the
danger is over,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;otherwise that man could not have
the heart to sing! If I live a century, I shall always like
a sailor&#8217;s song for the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is seldom that any person&#8217;s thankfulness after danger
bears a fair proportion to the fear they felt while it lasted;
but Harry and Laura had been taught to remember where
their gratitude was due, and felt it the more deeply next day,
when they entered the Yarmouth Roads, and were shewn
the masts of several vessels, appearing partly above the
water, which had on various occasions, been lost in that wilderness
of shoals, where so many melancholy catastrophes
have occurred.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">After sailing up the Thames, and duly staring at Greenwich
hospital, the hulks, and the Tower of London, they
landed at last; and having offered Mrs. Crabtree a place in
the hackney coach, they hurried impatiently into it, eager
for the happy moment of meeting with Frank. Harry, in
his ardour, thought that no carriage had ever driven so
slowly before. He wished there had been a rail-road through
the town; and far from wasting a thought upon the novelties
of Holborn or Piccadilly, he and Laura gained no idea
of the metropolis, more distinct than that of the Irishman
who complained he could not see London for the quantity
<a name="p0227.png" id="p0227.png" href="#p0227.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">227</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>of houses. One only idea filled their hearts, and brightened
their countenances, while they looked at each other with
a smile of delight, saying, &ldquo;now, at last, we are going to
see Frank!&rdquo;</p>

<div>What is life?&mdash;&mdash;a varied tale,</div>
<div>Deeply moving, quickly told.</div>
</div>
<div class="rt sc">Willis.</div>
</div>


<p class="noindent top1">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Oh</span>! what a lovely cottage!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura, in an
ecstacy of joy, when they stopped before a beautiful house,
with large airy windows down to the ground; walls that
seemed one brilliant mass of roses; rich flowery meadows
in front, and a bright smooth lawn behind, stretching down
to the broad bosom of the Thames, which reflected on its
glassy surface innumerable boats, filled with gay groups of
merry people. &ldquo;That is such a place as I have often dreamed
of, but never saw before! It seems made for perfect
happiness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! how delightful to live here with Frank and uncle
David!&rdquo; added Harry. &ldquo;We shall be sailing on the water
all day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cottage gate was now opened, and Major Graham
himself appeared under the porch; but instead of hurrying
forward, as he always formerly did, to welcome them after
the very shortest separation, he stood gravely and silently at
the door, without so much as raising his eyes from the
ground; and the paleness of his countenance filled both
Harry and Laura with astonishment. They flew to meet
<a name="p0229.png" id="p0229.png" href="#p0229.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">229</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>him, making an exclamation of joy; but after embracing
them affectionately, he did not utter a word, and led the way
with hurried and agitated steps into a sitting room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Frank?&rdquo; exclaimed Harry, looking eagerly
round. &ldquo;Why is he not here? Call him down! Tell him
we are come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A long pause ensued; and Laura trembled when she looked
at her uncle, who was some moments before he could
speak, and sat down taking each of them by the hand, with
such a look of sorrow and commiseration, that they were
filled with alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Harry and Laura!&rdquo; said he solemnly, &ldquo;you
have never known grief till now, but if you love me, listen
with composure. I have sad news to tell, yet it is of the
very greatest consequence that you should bear up with fortitude.
Frank is extremely ill; and the joy he felt about
your coming, has agitated him so much, that he is worse
than you can possibly conceive. It probably depends upon
your conduct now, whether he survives this night or not.
Frank knows you are here; he is impatient for you to embrace
him; he becomes more and more agitated every moment
the meeting is delayed; yet if you give way to childish
grief, or even to childish joy, upon seeing him again,
the Doctors think it may cause his immediate death. You
might hear his breathing in any part of this house. He is
in the lowest extreme of weakness! It will be a dreadful
scene for you both. Tell me, Harry and Laura, can you
trust yourselves? Can you, for Frank&#8217;s own sake, enter his
room this moment, as quietly as if you had seen him yesterday,
and speak to him with composure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura felt, on hearing these words, as if the very earth
had opened under her feet,&mdash;a choking sensation arose in
her throat,&mdash;her colour fled,&mdash;her limbs shook,&mdash;her whole
countenance became convulsed with anguish,&mdash;but making
<a name="p0230.png" id="p0230.png" href="#p0230.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">230</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>a resolute effort, she looked anxiously at Harry, and then
said, in a low, almost inaudible voice,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David! we are able,&mdash;God will strengthen us. I
dare not think a moment. The sooner it is done the better.
Let us go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Graham slowly led the way without speaking, till
they reach the bed-room door, where he paused for a moment,
while Harry and Laura listened to the gasping sound
of Frank struggling for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember you will scarcely know him,&rdquo; whispered he,
looking doubtfully at Laura&#8217;s pallid countenance; &ldquo;but a
single expression of emotion may be fatal. Show your love
for Frank now, my dear children. Spare him all agitation,&mdash;forget
your own feelings for his sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Harry and Laura entered the room, Frank buried
his face in his hands, and leaned them on the table, saying,
in convulsive accents, &ldquo;Go away, Laura!&mdash;oh go away
just now! I cannot bear it yet!&mdash;leave me!&mdash;leave me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Laura had been turned into marble at the moment, she
could not have seemed more perfectly calm, for her mind
was wound up to an almost supernatural effort, and advancing
to the place where he sat, without attempting to speak,
she took Frank by the hand&mdash;Harry did the same; and not
a sound was heard for some moments, but the convulsive
struggles of Frank himself, while he gasped for breath, and
vainly tried to speak, till at length he raised his head and
fixed his eyes on Laura, who felt then, for the first time,
struck with the dreadful conviction, that this meeting was
but a prelude to their immediate and final separation. The
pale ashy cheek, the hollow eye, the sharp and altered features,
all told a tale of anguish such as she had never before
conceived, and a cold tremor passed through her frame, as
she stood amazed and bewildered with grief, while the past,
the present, and the future seemed all one mighty heap of
agony. Still she gazed steadily on Frank, and said nothing,
<a name="p0231.png" id="p0231.png" href="#p0231.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">231</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>conscious that the smallest indulgence of emotion would
bring forth a torrent which nothing could control, and determined,
unless her heart ceased to beat, that he should see
nothing to increase his agitation.</p>

<p>At length, in a low, faint, broken voice, Frank was able
to speak, and looking with affectionate sympathy at Laura,
he said, &ldquo;Do not think, dear sister, that I always suffer as
you see me now. This joy has been too much for me. I
shall soon feel easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Graham observed a livid paleness come over
Laura&#8217;s countenance when she attempted to answer, and
seeing it was impossible to sustain the trial a moment longer,
he made a pretext to hurry her away. Harry instantly
followed, and rushing into a vacant room, he threw himself
down in an agony of grief, and wept convulsively, till the
very bed shook beneath him. Hours passed on, and Major
Graham left them to exhaust their grief in weeping together,
but every moment seemed only to increase their agitation,
as the conviction became more fearfully certain that Frank
was indeed lost to them for ever. This then was the meeting
they had so often, and so joyously anticipated! Laura
sunk upon her knees beside Harry, and prayers were mingled
with their tears, while they asked for consolation,
and tried to feel resigned. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; thought she solemnly,
&ldquo;how truly did grandmama say, &lsquo;If the sorrows of this
world are called &lsquo;light afflictions,&rsquo; what must be those from
which Christ died to save us!&rsquo; It is merciful that we
are not forbid to weep, for, oh! who ever lost such a brother?&mdash;the
kindest&mdash;the best of brothers!&mdash;dear, dear Frank!&mdash;can
nothing be done! Uncle David!&rdquo; added Laura,
clinging to Major Graham, when he entered the room,
&ldquo;oh! say something to us about Frank getting better,&mdash;do
you think he will? May we have a hope?&mdash;one single
hope to live upon, that Frank may possibly be spared;
do not turn away&mdash;do not look so very sad&mdash;think how
<a name="p0232.png" id="p0232.png" href="#p0232.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">232</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>young Frank is,&mdash;and the Doctors are so skilful&mdash;and&mdash;and
oh, uncle David! he is dying! I see it! I must believe
it!&rdquo; continued she, wringing her hands with grief. &ldquo;You
cannot give us one word of hope, though the whole world
would be nothing without him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&mdash;my very dear Laura! remember that consoling
text in holy Scripture, &lsquo;Be still, and know that I am
God;&rsquo;&mdash;we have no idea what He can do in saving us from
sorrow, or in comforting us when it comes, therefore let us
seek peace from Him, and believe that all shall indeed be
ordered well, even though our own hearts were to be
broken with affliction. Frank has seen old nurse Crabtree,
and is now in a refreshing sleep, therefore I wish you to
take the opportunity of sitting in his room, and accustoming
yourselves, if possible, to the sight of his altered appearance.
He is sometimes very cheerful, and always patient,
therefore we must keep up our own spirits, and try to
assist him in bearing his sufferings, rather than increase
them, by showing what we feel ourselves. I was pleased
with you both this morning&mdash;that meeting was no common
effort, and now we must show our submission to the Divine
will, difficult as that may be, by a deep, heartfelt resignation
to whatever He ordains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura still felt stupified with grief, but they
mechanically followed Major Graham into Frank&#8217;s room,
and sat down in a distant corner behind his chair, observing
with awe and astonishment his pallid countenance, his emaciated
hands, and his drooping figure, while scarcely yet
able to believe that this was indeed their own beloved Frank.
After they had remained immoveably still for some time,
though shedding many bitter tears, as they gazed on the
wreck of one so very dear, he suddenly started awake, and
glanced anxiously round the room, then with a look of deep
disappointment, he said to uncle David, in low, feeble accents,</p>

<p><a name="p0233.png" id="p0233.png" href="#p0233.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">233</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;It was only a dream! I have often dreamed the same
thing, when far away at sea,&mdash;that would have been too
much happiness! I fancied Harry and Laura were here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was no dream, dear Frank! we are here,&rdquo; said Laura,
trying to speak in a quiet, subdued voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sister! then all is well! but pray sit always
where I can see you. After wishing so long for our meeting,
it appears nearly impossible that we are together at
last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank became exhausted with speaking so much, but
pointed to a seat near himself, where Harry and Laura sat
down, after which he gazed at them long and earnestly, with
a look of affectionate pleasure, while his smile, which had
lost all its former cheerfulness, was now full of tenderness
and sensibility. At length his countenance gradually changed,
while large tears gathered in his eyes, and coursed each
other silently down his cheeks. Thoughts of the deepest
sadness seemed passing through his mind during some moments,
but checking the heavy sigh that rose in his breast,
he riveted his hands together, and looked towards heaven
with an expression of placid submission, saying these words
in a scarcely audible tone, though evidently addressed to
those around,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weeping endureth for a night, but joy cometh in the
morning.&rdquo; &ldquo;We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle
be dissolved, we have a building of God, an house
not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.&rdquo; &ldquo;Weep ye
not for the dead, neither bemoan him; <em>but</em> weep sore for
him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see
his native country.&rdquo;<sup><a name="fna.1"
 id="fna.1" href="#fn.1">*</a></sup></p>

<p>These words fell upon the ear of Harry and Laura like a
knell of death, for they now saw that Frank himself believed
he was dying, and it appeared as if their last spark of
<a name="p0234.png" id="p0234.png" href="#p0234.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">234</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>hope expired when they heard this terrible dispensation announced
from his own lips. He seemed anxious now that
they should understand his full meaning, and receive all the
consolation which his mind could afford, for he closed his
eyes, and added in solemn accents,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have died at some time, and why not now? If
I leave friends who are very dear on earth, I go to my chief
best friend in heaven. The whole peace and comfort of my
mind rest on thinking of our Saviour&#8217;s merits. Let us all
be ready to say, &lsquo;the will of the Lord be done.&rsquo; Think
often, Harry and Laura, of those words we so frequently repeated
to grandmama formerly:</p>

<div class="poem w20 pl4">
<div class="stanza notopspace">
<div>&lsquo;Take comfort, Christians, when your friends</div>
<div class="i2">  In Jesus fall asleep,</div>
<div>Their better being never ends,</div>
<div class="i2">  Why then dejected weep?</div>
<br /></div>

<div class="stanza">
<div>Why inconsolable as those</div>
<div class="i2">  To whom no hope is given?</div>
<div>Death is the messenger of peace,</div>
<div class="i2">  And calls &lsquo;my&rsquo; soul to Heaven.&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="top1">Frank&#8217;s voice failed, his head fell back upon the pillows,
and he remained for a length of time, with his eyes closed
in solemn meditation and prayer, while Laura and Harry,
unable so much as to look at each other, leaned upon the
table, and wept in silence.</p>

<p>Laura felt as if she had grown old in a moment,&mdash;as if
life could give no more joy&mdash;and as if she herself stood already
on the verge of the grave. It appeared like a dream
that she had ever been happy, and a dreadful reality to which
she was now awakened. &ldquo;Behold, God taketh away! who
can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils.&rdquo;
These were texts which forced themselves on her mind, with
mournful emphasis, while she felt how helpless is earthly
<a name="p0235.png" id="p0235.png" href="#p0235.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">235</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>affection when the dispensations of God are upon us. All
her love for Frank could not avert the stroke of death,&mdash;all
his attachment to her must now be buried in the grave,&mdash;and
the very tenderness they felt for each other, only embittered
the sorrows of this dreadful moment.</p>

<p>From that day, Harry and Laura, according to the
advice of uncle David, testified their affection for Frank,
not by tears and useless lamentations, though these were
not always to be controlled in private, but by the incessant,
devoted attention with which they watched his looks, anticipated
his wishes, and thought every exertion a pleasure
which could in the slightest degree contribute to his comfort.
Frank, on his part, spared their feelings, by often
concealing what he suffered, and by speaking of his own
death, as if it had been a journey on which he must prepare
with readiness to enter, reminding them, that never to
die, was never to be happy, as all they saw him endure from
sickness, became nothing to what he endured from struggling
against sin and temptation, which were the great evils
of existence,&mdash;and that from all these he would be for ever
freed by death. &ldquo;Those who are prepared for the change,&rdquo;
added he, solemnly, &ldquo;can neither live too long, nor die too
soon; for when God gives us His blessing, He then sends
heaven, as it were, into the soul before the soul ascends to
heaven; and I trust to being gifted with faith and submission
for all that may be ordained during my few remaining
hours upon earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, with every desire to feel resigned, Frank himself
was sometimes surprised out of his usual fortitude, especially
when thinking that he must never more hope to see
Lady Harriet, towards whom he cast many a longing and
affecting thought, saying once, with deep emotion, &ldquo;If I
could only see grandmama again, I should feel quite well!&rdquo;
One evening, as he sat near an open window, gazing on
the rich tints of twilight, and breathing with more than
<a name="p0236.png" id="p0236.png" href="#p0236.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">236</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>usual ease, a wandering musician paused with her guitar,
and sung several airs with great pathos and expression. At
length she played the tune of &ldquo;Home! sweet home,&rdquo; to
which Frank listened for some moments with intense agitation,
till, clasping his hands and bursting into tears, he
exclaimed, in accents of powerful emotion,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home! That happy home! Oh! never&mdash;never more,&mdash;<em>my</em>
home is in the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura wept convulsively while he added in broken accents,
&ldquo;I shall still be remembered&mdash;still lamented&mdash;you
must not love me too well, Laura,&mdash;not as I love you,
or your sorrow would be too great; but long hence, when
Harry and you are happy together, surrounded with friends,
think sometimes of one who must for ever be absent,&mdash;who
loved you better than them all,&mdash;whose last prayer will be
for you both. Oh! who can tell what my feelings are! I
can do nothing now but cause distress and anguish to those
who love me best!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank, I would not exchange your affection for the wealth
of worlds. As long as I live, it will be my greatest earthly
happiness to have had such a brother; and if we are to suffer
a sorrow that I cannot name, and dare not think of, you
are teaching me how to bear it, and leaving us the only
comfort we can have, in knowing that you are happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many plans and many hopes I had for the future,
Laura,&rdquo; added Frank; &ldquo;but there is no future to me now
in this world. Perhaps I may escape a multitude of sorrows,
but how gladly would I have shared all yours, and ensured
my best happiness by uniting with Harry and you in
living to God. If you both learn more by my death than
by my life, then, indeed, I do rejoice. With respect to myself,
it matters but little a few years or hours sooner, for I
may say, in the words of Job, &lsquo;though He slay me, yet will
I trust in Him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank&#8217;s sufferings increased every day, and became so
<a name="p0237.png" id="p0237.png" href="#p0237.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">237</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>very great at last, that the Doctor proposed giving him strong
doses of laudanum, to bring on a stupor and allay the pain;
but when this was mentioned to him, he said, &ldquo;I know it is
my duty to take whatever you prescribe, and I certainly
shall, but if we can do without opiates, let me entreat you
to refrain from them. Often formerly at sea I used to think
it very sad how few of those I attended in sickness were
allowed by the physician to die in possession of their senses,
on account of being made to take laudanum, which gave
them false spirits and temporary ease. Let me retain my
faculties as long as they are mercifully granted to me. I
can bear pain,&mdash;at least, God grant me strength to do so,&mdash;but
I cannot willingly enter the presence of my Creator in
a state little short of intoxication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many days of agony followed this resolution on the part
of Frank, but though the medicine, which would have
brought some hours of oblivion, lay within reach, he persevered
in wishing to preserve his consciousness, whatever
suffering it might cost; and though now and then a prayer
for bodily relief was wrung from him in his acute agony,
the most frequent and fervent supplications that he uttered
night and day were, in an accent of intense emotion, &ldquo;God
have mercy upon my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry and Laura were surprised to find the fields and
walks near London so very rural and beautiful as they appeared
at Hammersmith, and to meet with much more
simplicity and kindness among the common people than
they had anticipated. The poorer neighbours, who became
aware of their affliction, testified a degree of sympathy
which frequently astonished them, and was often afterwards
remembered with pleasure, one instance of which seemed
peculiarly touching to Laura. Frank always suffered most
acutely during the night, and seldom closed his eyes in
sleep till morning, therefore she invariably remained with
him, to beguile those weary hours, while any remonstrance
<a name="p0238.png" id="p0238.png" href="#p0238.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">238</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>on his part against so fatiguing a duty, became a mere
waste of words, as she only grew sadder and paler, saying,
there would be time enough to take care of herself when
she could no longer be of use to him. The earliest thing
that gave any relief to Frank&#8217;s cough every day, generally
was, a tumbler of milk, warm from the cow, which had
been ordered for him, and was brought almost as soon as
the dawn of light. Once, when Frank had been unusually
ill, and sighed in restless agony till morning, Laura watched
impatiently for day, and when the milkman was seen, at
six o&#8217;clock, slowly trudging through the fields, and advancing
leisurely towards the house, Laura hurried eagerly
down to meet him, exclaiming in accents of joy, while she
held out the tumbler, &ldquo;Oh! I am so glad you are come at
last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last, Miss!! I am as early as usual!&rdquo; replied he,
gruffly. &ldquo;It&#8217;s not many poor folks that gets up so soon
to their work, and if you had to labour as hard as me all
day, you would maybe think the morning came too soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am seldom in bed all night,&rdquo; answered Laura, sadly.
&ldquo;My poor sick brother cannot rest till this milk is brought,
and I wait with him, hour after hour till daylight, wearying
for you to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old dairyman looked with sorrowful surprise at Laura,
while she, thinking no more of what had passed, hurried
away; but next morning, when sitting up again with
Frank, she became surprised to observe the milkman a
whole hour earlier than usual, plodding along towards his
cattle at a peculiarly rapid pace. He stayed not more than
five minutes, only milking one cow, though all the others
gathered round him, and as soon as he had filled his little
pail, he came straight toward Major Graham&#8217;s cottage, and
knocked at the door. Laura instantly ran down to thank
him with her whole heart for his kind attention, after which,
<a name="p0239.png" id="p0239.png" href="#p0239.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">239</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>as long as Frank continued ill, the old dairyman rose long
before his usual time, to bring this welcome refreshment.</p>

<p>Frank desired Laura to beg that he would not take so
much trouble, or else to insist on his accepting some remuneration,
but the old man would neither discontinue the
custom, nor receive any recompense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see this kind good dairyman, to thank him myself,&rdquo;
said Frank, one night, when he felt rather easier; and
next morning, Laura invited poor Teddy Collins to walk
up stairs, who looked exceedingly astonished, though very
much pleased at the proposal, saying, &ldquo;May be, Ma&#8217;am,
the poor young gentleman would not like to see a stranger
like me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is a stranger who feels for him as you have
done,&rdquo; replied Laura, leading the way, and Frank&#8217;s countenance
lighted up with a smile of pleasure when they entered
his room. He held out his thin emaciated hand to Teddy,
who looked earnestly and sorrowfully in his face as he
grasped hold of it, saying, &ldquo;You look very poorly, Sir!
I&#8217;m afraid, indeed, you are sadly ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I am! as ill as any one can be on this side of
eternity! My tale is told, my days are numbered; but I
would not go out of this world without saying how grateful
we both feel for your attention. As a cup of cold water
given in Christian kindness shall hereafter be rewarded, I
trust also that your attention to me may not be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are heartily welcome, Sir! It is a great honour
for a poor old man like me to oblige anybody. I shall not long
be able for work now, seeing that I am upwards of threescore
and ten, and my days are already full of labour and
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To both of us, then, the night is far spent, and the day
is at hand,&rdquo; replied Frank&mdash;&ldquo;How strange it seems, that,
old as you are. I am still older; my feeble frame will be
sooner worn out, and my body laid at rest in the grave!
<a name="p0240.png" id="p0240.png" href="#p0240.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">240</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>Let me hope that you have already applied your heart to wisdom,
for every child of earth must, sooner or later, find how
short is every thing but eternity. While I appear before you
here as a spectacle of mortality, think how soon and how
certainly you must follow. May you then find, as I do, that
even in the last extreme of sickness and sorrow, there is
comfort in looking forward to such blessings as &lsquo;eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard.&rsquo; Farewell, my kind friend! In
this world we shall meet no more, but there is another and
a better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man, apparently unwilling to withdraw, paused
for some moments after Frank had ceased to speak. He
muttered a few inaudible words in reply, and then slowly
and sorrowfully left the room, while Frank&#8217;s head sunk languidly
on the pillows, and Laura retired to her room, where,
as usual, she wept herself to sleep.</p>

<p>When Harry and Laura first arrived at Hammersmith,
Frank felt anxious that they should walk out every day for
the benefit of their health; but finding that each made frequent
excuses for remaining constantly with him at home,
he invented a plan which induced them to take exercise regularly.</p>

<p>Being early in June, strawberries were yet so exceedingly
rare, that they could scarcely be had for any money; but the
Doctor had allowed his patient to eat fruit. Frank asked his
two young attendants to wander about in quest of gardens
where a few strawberries could be got, and to bring him
some. Accordingly, they set out one morning; and after
a long, unsuccessful search, at last observed a small green-house
near the road, with one little basket in the window,
scarcely larger than a thimble, containing two or three delicious
King seedlings, perfectly ripe. These were to be
sold for five shillings; but hardly waiting to ascertain the
price, Laura seized this welcome prize with delight, and paid
for it on the spot. Every morning afterwards, her regular
<a name="p0241.png" id="p0241.png" href="#p0241.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">241</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>walk was to hasten with Harry towards this pretty little shop,
where they talked to the gardener about poor Frank being
so very ill, and told him that this fine fruit was wanted for
their sick brother at home.</p>

<p>One day the invalid seemed so much worse than usual,
that neither Harry nor Laura could bear to leave him a moment;
so they requested Mrs. Crabtree to fetch the strawberries,
which she readily agreed to do; but on drawing out
her purse in the shop, and saying that she came to buy that
little basket of fruit at the window, what was her astonishment
when the gardener looked civil and sorry, answering
that he would not sell those strawberries if she offered him
a guinea a-piece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Crabtree, getting into a rage;
&ldquo;then what do you put them up at the window for? There
is no use pretending to keep a shop, if you will not sell
what is in it! Give me these strawberries this minute, and
here&#8217;s your five shillings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s quite impossible,&rdquo; replied the gardener, holding back
the basket. &ldquo;You see, ma&#8217;am, every day last week a little
Master and Miss came to this here shop, buying my strawberries
for a young gentleman who is very ill; and they look
both so sweet and so mournful-like, that I would not disappoint
them for all the world. They seem later to-day than
usual, and are, may be, not coming at all; but if I lose my
day&#8217;s profits, it can&#8217;t be helped. They shall not walk here
for nothing, if they please to come!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">When Mrs. Crabtree explained that she belonged to the
same family as Harry and Laura, the gardener looked hard
at her to see if she were attempting to deceive him; but
feeling convinced that she spoke the truth, he begged her to
carry off the basket to his young friends, positively refusing
to take the price.</p>

<div>But they who wait upon the Lord,</div>

</div>
</div>


<p class="noindent top1"><span class="sc">Frank</span> felt no unnatural apathy or indifference about dying,
for he looked upon it with awe, though not with fear; nor
did he express any rapturous excitement on the solemn occasion,
knowing that death is an appointed penalty for
transgression, which, though deprived of its sharpest sting
by the triumphs of the cross, yet awfully testifies to all succeeding
generations, that each living man has individually
merited the utmost wrath of God, and that the last moment
on earth, of even the most devoted Christian, must be darkened
by the gloom of our original sin and natural corruption.
Yet, &ldquo;as in Adam all die, so in Christ are all made
alive;&rdquo; and amidst the throng of consolatory and affecting
meditations that crowded into his mind on the great subject
of our salvation, he kept a little book in which were
carefully recorded such texts and reflections as he considered
likely to strengthen his own faith, and to comfort those
he left behind&mdash;saying one day to Major Graham,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell grandmama, that though my days have been few
upon the earth, they were happy! When you think of me,
uncle David, after my sufferings are over, it may well be a

kindest of friends. Oh! how kind! but I must not&mdash;cannot
speak of <span class="nw">that&mdash;&mdash;.</span> This is my birth-day!&mdash;my
last birth-day! Many a joyous one we kept together, but
those merry days are over, and these sadder ones too shall
cease; yet the time is fast approaching, so welcome to us
both,</p>

<div>&lsquo;When death-divided friends at last</div>
<div>Shall meet to part no more.&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="top1">In the evening, Major Graham observed that Frank made
Mrs. Crabtree bring everything belonging to him, and lay it
on the table, when he employed himself busily in tying
up a number of little parcels, remarking, with a languid
smile,</p>

<p>&ldquo;My possessions are not valuable, but these are for some
old friends and messmates, who will be pleased to receive a
trifling memorial of one who loved them. Send my dirk
to Peter Grey, who is much reformed now. Here are all
the letters any of you ever sent me; how very often they
have been read! but now, even that intercourse must end;
keep them, for they were the dearest treasures I possessed.
At Madras, formerly, I remember hearing of a nabob who
was bringing his whole fortune home in a chest of gold,
but the ropes for hoisting his treasure on board were so insufficient,
that the whole gave way, and it fell into the
ocean, never to be recovered. That seemed a very sudden
termination of his hopes and plans, but scarcely more unexpected
than my own. &lsquo;We are a wind that passeth away
and cometh not again.&rsquo; Many restless nights are ordained
for me now, probably that I may find no resource but prayer
and meditation. Others can afford time to slumber, but
I so soon shall sleep the sleep of death, that it becomes a
blessing to have such hours of solitary thought, for preparing
my heart and establishing my faith, during this moment
of need.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0244.png" id="p0244.png" href="#p0244.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">244</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Yes, Frank! but your prayers are not solitary, for ours
are joined to yours,&rdquo; added Laura. &ldquo;I read in an old author
lately, that Christian friends in this world might be
compared to travellers going along the same road in separate
carriages&mdash;sometimes they are together&mdash;often they are
apart&mdash;sometimes they can exchange assistance, as we do
now&mdash;and often they jostle against each other, till at last,
having reached the journey&#8217;s end, they are removed out of
these earthly vehicles into a better state, where they shall
look back upon former circumstances, and know even as
they are known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura was often astonished to observe the change which
had taken place in her own character and feelings within
the very short period of their distress. Her extreme terror
of a thunder-storm formerly, had occasioned many a jest to
her brothers, when Harry used, occasionally, to roll heavy
weights in the room above her own, to imitate the loudest
peals, while Frank sometimes endeavoured to argue her out
of that excessive apprehension with which she listened to
the most distant surmise of a storm. Now, however, at
Hammersmith, long after midnight, the moon, on one occasion,
became completely obscured by dense heavy clouds,
and the air felt so oppressively hot, that Frank, who seemed
unusually breathless, drew closer to the window. Laura
supported his head, and was deeply occupied in talking to
him, when suddenly a broad flash of lightning glared into
the room, followed by a crash of thunder, that seemed to
crack the very heavens. Again and again the lightning
gleamed in her face with such vividness, that Laura fancied
she could distinguish the heat of it, and yet she stirred not,
nor did a single exclamation, as in former days, arise on
her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray shut the window, Laura,&rdquo; said Frank languidly,
raising his eyes; &ldquo;and be so kind as to close the shutters!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="p0245.png" id="p0245.png" href="#p0245.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">245</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Why, Frank?&mdash;you never used to be alarmed by thunder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!<!-- original has spurious closing quote --> nor am I now, dear Laura. What danger need
a dying person fear? Some few hours sooner or later would
be of little <span class="nw">consequence&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem w18 pl4">
<div class="stanza notopspace">
<div>Come he slow, or come he fast,</div>
<div>It is but death that comes at last.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent top1">Yet, Laura, do you think I have forgotten old times! Oh,
no!&mdash;not while I live. You attend to my feelings, and
surely it is my duty to remember yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind me, Frank!&rdquo; whispered Laura. &ldquo;I have
got over all that folly. When real fears and sorrows come,
we care no more about those that were imaginary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, my dear sister; and there is no courage or fortitude
like that derived from faith in a superintending providence.
Though all creation reel, we may sleep in peace,
for to Christians &lsquo;danger is safe, and tumult calm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Frank grew worse, he became often delirious.
Yet as in health he had been habitually cheerful, his mind
generally wandered to agreeable subjects. He fancied himself
walking on the bright meadows, and picking flowers by
the river side,&mdash;meeting Lady Harriet,&mdash;and even speaking
to his father, as if Sir Edward had been present; while
Harry and Laura listened, weeping and trembling, to behold
the wreck of such a mind and heart as his. One
evening, he seemed unusually well, and requested that his
arm-chair might be wheeled to the open window, where he
gazed with delight at the hills and meadows,&mdash;the clouds
and glittering water,&mdash;the cattle standing in the stream,&mdash;the
boats reflected on its surface,&mdash;and the roses fluttering
at every casement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those joyous little birds!&mdash;their song makes me cheerful,&rdquo;
said he, in a tone of placid enjoyment. &ldquo;I have been
in countries where the birds never sing, and the leaves
<a name="p0246.png" id="p0246.png" href="#p0246.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">246</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>never fade; but they excited no sympathy or interest. Here
we have notes of gladness both in sunshine and storm,
teaching us a lesson of grateful contentment,&mdash;while those
drooping roses preach a sermon to me, for as easily might
they recover freshness and bloom as myself. We shall
both lie low before long in the dust, yet a spring shall come
hereafter to revive even &lsquo;the ashes of the urn.&rsquo; Then,
uncle David, we meet again,&mdash;not as now, amidst sorrow
and suffering, with death and separation before us,&mdash;but
blessed by the consciousness that our sins are forgiven,&mdash;our
trials all ended,&mdash;and that our afflictions which were
but for a moment, have worked out for us a far more exceeding,
even an eternal weight of glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some hours afterwards the Doctor entered. After receiving
a cordial welcome from Frank, and feeling his
pulse, he instantly examined his arms and neck, which were
covered entirely over with small red spots, upon observing
which, the friendly physician suddenly changed countenance,
and stole an alarmed glance at Major Graham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel easier and better to-day, Doctor, than at any time
since my illness,&rdquo; said Frank, looking earnestly in his
face. &ldquo;Do you think this eruption will do me good? Life
has much that would be dear to me, while I have friends
like these to live for. Can it be possible that I may yet recover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor turned away, unable to reply, while Frank
intensely watched his countenance, and then gazed at the
pale agitated face of Major Graham. Gradually the hope
which had brightened in his cheek began to fade,&mdash;the lustre
of his eye became dim,&mdash;his countenance settled into
an expression of mournful resignation,&mdash;and covering his
face with his hands, he said, in a voice of deep emotion,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see how it is!&mdash;God&#8217;s will be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The silence of death succeeded, while Frank laid his
head on the pillow and closed his eyes. A few natural tears
<a name="p0247.png" id="p0247.png" href="#p0247.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">247</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>coursed each other slowly down his cheek; but at length,
an hour or two afterwards, being completely exhausted, he
fell into a gentle sleep, from which the Doctor considered it
very doubtful if he would ever awaken, as the red spots indicated
mortification, which must inevitably terminate his
life before next day.</p>

<p>Laura retired to the window, making a strenuous effort to
restrain her feelings, that she might be enabled to witness
the last awful scene; and fervently did she pray for such
strength to sustain it with fortitude, as might still render her
of some use to her dying brother. Her pale countenance
might almost have been mistaken for that of a corpse, but
for the expression of living agony in her eye; and she was
sunk in deep, solemn thought, when her attention became
suddenly roused by observing a chariot and four drive furiously
up to the gate, while the horses were foaming and
panting as they stopped. A tall gentleman, of exceedingly
striking appearance, sprung hurriedly out, walked rapidly
towards the cottage door, and in another minute entered
Frank&#8217;s room, with the animated look of one who expected
to be gladly welcomed, and to occasion an agreeable surprise.</p>

<p>Harry and Laura shrunk close to their uncle, when the
stranger, now in evident agitation, gazed round the room
with an air of painful astonishment, till Major Graham
looked round, and instantly started up with an exclamation
of amazement, &ldquo;Edward! is it possible! This is indeed
a consolation! you are still in time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In time!!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Edward, grasping his
brother&#8217;s hand with vehement agitation. &ldquo;Do you mean to
say that Frank is yet in danger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Graham mournfully shook his head, and undrawing
the bed curtains, he silently pointed to the sleeping countenance
of Frank, which was as still as death, and already
overspread by a ghastly paleness. Sir Edward then sunk
into a chair, and clenched his hands over his forehead with
<a name="p0248.png" id="p0248.png" href="#p0248.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">248</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>a look of unspeakable anguish, saying, in an under-tone,
&ldquo;Worn out, as I am, in mind and body, I needed not this
to destroy me! Say at once, brother, is there any hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None, my dear Edward! None! Even now he is insensible,
and I fear with little prospect of ever becoming
conscious again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment Frank opened his eyes, which were dim
and glassy, while it became evident that he had relapsed
into a state of temporary delirium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get more candles! how very dark it is!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Who are all those people? Send away everybody but
grandmama! I must speak to her alone. Never tell papa
of all this, it would only distress him&mdash;say nothing about
me. Why do Harry and Laura never come? They have
been absent more than a week! Who took away uncle
David too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura listened for some time in an agony of grief, till at
last, unable any longer to restrain her feelings, she clasped
Frank in her arms and burst into tears, exclaiming, in accents
of piercing distress, &ldquo;Oh Frank! dear Frank! have
you forgotten poor Laura?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till I am dead!&rdquo; whispered he, while a momentary
gleam of recollection lighted up his face. &ldquo;Laura! we
meet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Edward now wished to speak, but Frank had relapsed
into a state of feeble unconsciousness, from which nothing
could arouse him; once or twice he repeated the name of
Laura in a low melancholy voice, till it became totally inaudible&mdash;his
breath became shorter&mdash;his lips became livid&mdash;his
whole frame seemed convulsed&mdash;and some hours afterwards,
all that was mortal of Frank Graham ceased to
exist. About four in the morning his body was at rest, and
his spirit returned to God who gave it.</p>

<p>The candles had burned low in their sockets, and still
the mourners remained, unwilling to move from the awful
<a name="p0249.png" id="p0249.png" href="#p0249.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">249</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>scene of their bereavement. Mrs. Crabtree at length, who
laid out the body herself, extinguished the lights, and flung
open the window curtains. Then suddenly a bright blaze
of sunshine streamed into the room, and rested on the cold
pale face of the dead. To the stunned and bewildered
senses of Harry and Laura, the brilliant dawn of morning
seemed like a mockery of their distress. Many persons
were already passing by&mdash;the busy stir of life had begun,
and a boy strolling along the road whistled his merry tune
as he went gaily on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are indeed mere atoms in the world!&rdquo; thought
Laura bitterly, while these sights and sounds fell heavily on
her heart. <!-- original lacks opening quote -->&ldquo;If Harry and I had both been dead also, the sun
would have shone as brightly, the birds sung as joyfully, and
those people been all as gay and happy as ever! Nobody
is thinking of Frank&mdash;nobody knows our misery&mdash;the
world is going on as if nothing had happened, and we are
breaking our hearts with grief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura&#8217;s heart became stilled as she gazed on the peaceful
and almost happy expression of those beautiful features,
which had now lost all appearance of suffering. The eyes,
from which nothing but kindness and love had beamed upon
her, were now closed for ever; the lips which had spoken
only words of generous affection and pious hope, were
silent; and the heart which had beat with every warm and
brotherly feeling, was for the first time insensible to her sorrows;
yet Laura did not give way to the strong excess of
her grief, for it sunk upon her spirit with a leaden weight
of anguish, which tears and lamentations could not express,
and could not even relieve. She rose and kissed, for the
last time, that beloved countenance, which she was never to
look upon again till they met in heaven, and stole away to
the silence and solitude of her own room, where Laura tried
in vain to collect her thoughts. All seemed a dreary blank.
She did not sigh&mdash;she could not weep; but she sat in dark
<a name="p0250.png" id="p0250.png" href="#p0250.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">250</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and vacant abstraction, with one only consciousness filling
her mind&mdash;the bitter remembrance that Frank was dead&mdash;that
she could be of no farther use to him&mdash;that she could
have no future intercourse with him&mdash;that even in her prayers
she could no longer have the comfort of naming him;
and when at last she turned to his own Bible which he had
given her, to seek for consolation, her eyes refused their office,
and the pages became blistered with tears.</p>

<p>After Frank&#8217;s funeral, Sir Edward became too ill to leave
his bed; and Major Graham remained with him in constant
conversation; while Harry and Laura did every thing to
testify their affection, and to fill the place now so sadly vacant.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday, several of the congregation at
Hammersmith observed two young strangers in the rector&#8217;s
pew, dressed in the deepest mourning, with pale and downcast
countenances, who glided early into church, and sat
immoveably still, side by side, while Mr. Palmer gave out
for his text the affecting and appropriate words which Frank
himself had often repeated during his last illness, &ldquo;In an
hour that ye think not, the Son of man cometh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a tear was shed by either Harry or Laura,&mdash;their
grief was too great for utterance; yet they listened with
breathless interest to the sermon, intended not only to console
them, but also to instruct other young persons, from the
afflicting event of Frank&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>Mr. Palmer took this opportunity to describe all the amiable
dispositions of youth, and to show how much of what
is pleasing may appear before religion has yet taken entire
possession of the mind; but he painted in glowing colours
the beautiful consistency and harmony of character which
must ensue after that happy change, when the Holy Spirit
renews the heart and influences the life. It almost seemed
to Harry and Laura as if Frank were visibly before their
eyes, when Mr. Palmer spoke in eloquent terms of that
<a name="p0251.png" id="p0251.png" href="#p0251.png"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">251</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>humility which no praise could diminish&mdash;that benevolence
which attended to the feelings, as well as the wants of others,&mdash;that
affection which was ever ready to make any sacrifice
for those he loved,&mdash;that docility which obeyed the call of
duty on every occasion,&mdash;that meekness in the midst of provocation
which could not be irritated,&mdash;that gentle firmness
in maintaining the truths of the gospel, which no opposition
could intimidate,&mdash;that cheerful submission to suffering
which saw a hand of mercy in the darkest hour,&mdash;and that
faith which was ever &ldquo;forgetting those things which are behind,
and reaching forth unto those things which are before,&mdash;pressing
toward the mark for the prize of the high calling
of God in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed as if years had passed over the heads of Harry
and Laura during the short period of their absence from
home&mdash;that home where Frank had so anxiously desired to
go! All was changed within and around them,&mdash;sorrow had
filled their hearts, and no longer merry, thoughtless creatures,
believing the world one scene of frolicsome enjoyment and
careless ease; they had now witnessed its realities,&mdash;they
had felt its trials,&mdash;they had experienced the importance of
religion,&mdash;they had learned the frailty of all earthly joy,&mdash;and
they had received, amidst tears and sorrows, the last injunction
of a dying brother, to &ldquo;call upon the Lord while
He is near, and to seek Him while he may yet be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle David,&rdquo; said Laura one day, several months after
their return home, &ldquo;Mrs. Crabtree first endeavoured to lead
us aright by severity,&mdash;you and grandmama then tried what
kindness could do, but nothing was effectual till now, when
God Himself has laid His hand upon us. Oh! what a
heavy stroke was necessary to bring me to my right mind,
but now, while we weep many bitter tears, Harry and I often
pray together that good may come out of evil, and that
&lsquo;we who mourn so deeply, may find our best, our only
comfort from above&rsquo;.&rdquo;<!-- original has quotation in double quotes and lacks closing quote for speech --></p>
